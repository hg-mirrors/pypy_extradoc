Christian's travel to the USA
=============================

How it began
------------

September 2nd:

Phone call from Amanda Arnett/Grace Law, Foundation Systems.
"Would you like to work for EWT LLC?"

--> company overview

Found me by Email conversation on PyPy between Armin and me.

Arrangements for phone calls with John Benediktsson (CTO), Jason Wells (CPM)
Rodney Faragalla (CEO)

Preference for full-time employees.

Pause!


October 15th:

Phone call, "can you come"?

Making plans for Nov. 4th to Nov. 11th.

Arrived on the 3rd, started on Friday 4th.
Introduction into the system, problem description.

Java application, all written in Java. Looked into
Wallstreet - Java cannot be good. Python?
Recoded Python app 10 times slower.
Needed a hard-core Pythoneer to speed that up. me? :-)

Stopped them after 40 minutes: "I need to think"  :-)

--> clob.py

First approach:
Using RPython to do parsing of the data into tuples as fast as possible.

Only little faster than using Psyco, expense of the post-processing.

Started over, half-heartedly: Translating the whole application.
Will that work?

After half time of stay, I was confident and asked for extension.
"Stay as long as you like!".
Extended to stay until Fri. 19th.

Thu., 18th: Visit of a propellerhead company "Applied Minds Inc".
Alan Kay has his office there. Is a consultant for EWT.

Fri., 19th:
Arrived at 65% of Java speed.

David Salomon -> wants me badly to talk to Alan Kay

Extending to Wed., 23rd.

Tue., 22nd: 
Got 102% of Java speed. Checking in.
Colloquium with Alan Kaye.
Talked 1.5 hours about PyPy, without preparation (phew).
Alan: "Now that I know PyPy, I like Python *much* better".

"Nice smalltalk, but no 'squeak' when shaking hands" :-)

Future plans of EWT:

After they saw what is possible with PyPy, David asked
"How much money does the EU spend on this?" (Laugh)
"I can do this alone, twice!"

Modelled after Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)

--  BARC  --  (Beverly Advanced Research Center?)

Criteria: "The core Python people seem to have the right mind set"

The best way to predict the future is to invent it!
— Alan Kay


Overall result:
---------------

EWT has a huge interest in using Python as their main development
language and to be able to produce fast code at the same time.
They are very happy with the RPython results and find the code
readable enough.

They want to support the PyPy project as much as they can.

They are asking us how to do that. They don't want to break the project.

Coming to the PyCon 2006 sprint

Inviting to a sprint at EWT in Beverly hills?


Problems with RPython
---------------------

- needs a bit more support

- deriving from builtin types

- properties would be convenient

- some provision to publish an RPython object to CPython
  currently did that by hand, by creating new objects.

- explict spelling which objects are to be taken from CPython
  and which are to be imported (I started that, but it needs more concept)
 
- better error handling
  the cause of errors is sometimes hard to track down.
  
- a new object space, describing what CPython is?

We agreed that I shouldwrite this up, to be discussed in the TB meeting.

Ideas
-----

Replace CPython modules by RPython generated code, step by step.
Use that to make porting of Stackless Python simpler.
Putting PyPy into production, right now.

"Two-sided" approach of replacing CPython.
PyPy from the top, RPython from the bottom.


Personal Opinion:
-----------------

Biggest fish I ever landed.
"Do it now, or loose forever".

Consequences
------------

the PyPy project, long-term:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

EWT is most probably going to support PyPy very much
and might take over sponsorship after the EU project ends.
Provided we can find an arrangement that fits both parties.

No intrusion into open-sourced-ness.

myself, almost immediately
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

EWT wants me to work for them as much as possible.
At the same time, they are aware of the bulk of promised work
tismerysoft has to fulfil.

Hire one or two people for tismerysoft, to get the funding? Whom?

Not hiring in the first place, but asking EWT to give the money
for employing part-time consultants?

Interested/available people I've been talking with already:
- Gromit
- Stephan Diehl

Ideas?

Marius might be interested
