Inside cpyext: Why emulating CPython C API is so Hard
=====================================================

``cpyext`` is PyPy's subsystem which provides a compatibility
layer to compile and run CPython C extensions inside PyPy.  Often people ask
why a particular C extension doesn't work or is very slow on PyPy.
Usually it is hard to answer without going into technical details. The goal of
this blog post is to explain some of these technical details, so that we can
simply link here instead of explaining again and again :).

From a 10.000 foot view, ``cpyext`` is PyPy's version of ``"Python.h"``. Every time
you compile an extension which uses that header file, you are using ``cpyext``.
This includes extension explicitly written in C (such as ``numpy``) and
extensions which are generated from other compilers/preprocessors
(e.g. ``Cython``).

At the time of writing, the current status is that most C extensions "just
work". Generally speaking, you can simply ``pip install`` them,
provided they use the public, `official C API`_ instead of poking at private
implementation details.  However, the performance of cpyext is generally
poor. A Python program which makes heavy use of ``cpyext`` extensions
is likely to be slower on PyPy than on CPython.

Note: in this blog post we are talking about Python 2.7 because it is still
the default version of PyPy: however most of the implementation of ``cpyext`` is
shared with PyPy3, so everything applies to that as well.

C API Overview
---------------

In CPython, which is written in C, Python objects are represented as ``PyObject*``,
i.e. (mostly) opaque pointers to some common "base struct".

CPython uses a very simple memory management scheme: when you create an
object, you allocate a block of memory of the appropriate size on the heap.
Depending on the details, you might end up calling different allocators, but
for the sake of simplicity, you can think that this ends up being a call to
``malloc()``. The resulting block of memory is initialized and casted to to
``PyObject*``: this address never changes during the object lifetime, and the
C code can freely pass it around, store it inside containers, retrieve it
later, etc.

Memory is managed using reference counting. When you create a new reference to
an object, or you discard a reference you own, you have to increment_ or
decrement_ the reference counter accordingly. When the reference counter goes to
0, it means that the object is no longer used and can safely be
destroyed. Again, we can simplify and say that this results in a call to
``free()``, which finally releases the memory which was allocated by ``malloc()``.

.. _increment: https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_INCREF
.. _decrement: https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_DECREF

Generally speaking, the only way to operate on a ``PyObject*`` is to call the
appropriate API functions. For example, to convert a given ``PyObject*`` to a C
integer, you can use `PyInt_AsLong()`_; to add two objects together, you can
call `PyNumber_Add()`_.

.. _`PyInt_AsLong()`: https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/int.html#c.PyInt_AsLong
.. _`PyNumber_Add()`: https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Add

Internally, PyPy uses a similar approach. All Python objects are subclasses of
the RPython ``W_Root`` class, and they are operated by calling methods on the
``space`` singleton, which represents the interpreter.

At first, it looks very easy to write a compatibility layer: just make
``PyObject*`` an alias for ``W_Root``, and write simple RPython functions
(which will be translated to C by the RPython compiler) which call the
``space`` accordingly:

.. sourcecode:: python

   def PyInt_AsLong(space, o):
       return space.int_w(o)

   def PyNumber_Add(space, o1, o2):
       return space.add(o1, o2)


Actually, the code above is not too far from the actual
implementation. However, there are tons of gory details which make it much
harder than it looks, and much slower unless you pay a lot of attention
to performance.


The PyPy GC
-----------

To understand some of ``cpyext`` challenges, you need to have at least a rough
idea of how the PyPy GC works.

Contrarily to the popular belief, the "Garbage Collector" is not only about
collecting garbage: instead, it is generally responsible for all memory
management, including allocation and deallocation.

Whereas CPython uses a combination of malloc/free/refcounting to manage
memory, the PyPy GC uses a completely different approach. It is designed
assuming that a dynamic language like Python behaves the following way:

  - You create, either directly or indirectly, lots of objects.

  - Most of these objects are temporary and very short-lived. Think e.g. of
    doing ``a + b + c``: you need to allocate an object to hold the temporary
    result of ``a + b``, then it dies very quickly because you no longer need it
    when you do the final ``+ c`` part.

  - Only small fraction of the objects survive and stay around for a while.

So, the strategy is: make allocation as fast as possible; make deallocation of
short-lived objects as fast as possible; find a way to handle the remaining
small set of objects which actually survive long enough to be important.

This is done using a **Generational GC**: the basic idea is the following:

  1. We have a nursery, where we allocate "young objects" very quickly.

  2. When the nursery is full, we start what we call a "minor collection". 
     
     - We do a quick scan to determine the small set of objects which survived so
       far

     - We **move** these objects out of the nursery, and we place them in the
       area of memory which contains the "old objects". Since the address of the
       objects changes, we fix all the references to them accordingly.

  4. now the nursery contains only objects which "died young". We can
     discard all of them very quickly, reset the nursery, and use the same area
     of memory to allocate new objects from now.

In practice, this scheme works very well and it is one of the reasons why PyPy
is much faster than CPython.  However, careful readers have surely noticed
that this is a problem for ``cpyext``. On one hand, we have PyPy objects which
can potentially move and change their underlying memory address; on the other
hand, we need a way to represent them as fixed-address ``PyObject*`` when we
pass them to C extensions.  We surely need a way to handle that.


``PyObject*`` in PyPy
---------------------

Another challenge is that sometimes, ``PyObject*`` structs are not completely
opaque: there are parts of the public API which expose to the user specific
fields of some concrete C struct. For example the definition of PyTypeObject_
which exposes many of the ``tp_*`` slots to the user.
Since the low-level layout of PyPy ``W_Root`` objects is completely different
than the one used by CPython, we cannot simply pass RPython objects to C; we
need a way to handle the difference.

.. _PyTypeObject: https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/typeobj.html

So, we have two issues so far: objects can move, and incompatible
low-level layouts. ``cpyext`` solves both by decoupling the RPython and the C
representations. We have two "views" of the same entity, depending on whether
we are in the PyPy world (the movable ``W_Root`` subclass) or in the C world
(the non-movable ``PyObject*``).

``PyObject*`` are created lazily, only when they are actually needed. The
vast majority of PyPy objects are never passed to any C extension, so we don't
pay any penalty in that case. However, the first time we pass a ``W_Root`` to
C, we allocate and initialize its ``PyObject*`` counterpart.

The same idea applies also to objects which are created in C, e.g. by calling
`PyObject_New()`_. At first, only the ``PyObject*`` exists and it is
exclusively managed by reference counting. As soon as we pass it to the PyPy
world (e.g. as a return value of a function call), we create its ``W_Root``
counterpart, which is managed by the GC as usual.

.. _`PyObject_New()`: https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/allocation.html#c.PyObject_New

Here we start to see why calling cpyext modules is more costly in PyPy than in
CPython. We need to pay some penalty for all the conversions between
``W_Root`` and ``PyObject*``.

Moreover, the first time we pass a ``W_Root`` to C we also need to allocate
the memory for the ``PyObject*`` using a slowish "CPython-style" memory
allocator. In practice, for all the objects which are passed to C we pay more
or less the same costs as CPython, thus effectively "undoing" the speedup
guaranteed by PyPy's Generational GC under normal circumstances.


Maintaining the link between ``W_Root`` and ``PyObject*``
-----------------------------------------------------------

We now need a way to convert between ``W_Root`` and ``PyObject*`` and
vice-versa; also, we need to to ensure that the lifetime of the two entities
are in sync. In particular:

  1. as long as the ``W_Root`` is kept alive by the GC, we want the
     ``PyObject*`` to live even if its refcount drops to 0;

  2. as long as the ``PyObject*`` has a refcount greater than 0, we want to
     make sure that the GC does not collect the ``W_Root``.

The ``PyObject*`` â‡¨ ``W_Root`` link is maintained by the special field
`ob_pypy_link`_ which is added to all ``PyObject*``. On a 64 bit machine this
means that all ``PyObject*`` have 8 bytes of overhead, but then the
conversion is very quick, just reading the field.

For the other direction, we generally don't want to do the same: the
assumption is that the vast majority of ``W_Root`` objects will never be
passed to C, and adding an overhead of 8 bytes to all of them is a
waste. Instead, in the general case the link is maintained by using a
dictionary, where ``W_Root`` are the keys and ``PyObject*`` the values.

However, for a `few selected`_ ``W_Root`` subclasses we **do** maintain a
direct link using the special ``_cpy_ref`` field to improve performance. In
particular, we use it for ``W_TypeObject`` (which is big anyway, so a 8 bytes
overhead is negligible) and ``W_NoneObject``. ``None`` is passed around very
often, so we want to ensure that the conversion to ``PyObject*`` is very
fast. Moreover it's a singleton, so the 8 bytes overhead is negligible as
well.

This means that in theory, passing an arbitrary Python object to C is
potentially costly, because it involves doing a dictionary lookup.  We assume
that this cost will eventually show up in the profiler: however, at the time
of writing there are other parts of ``cpyext`` which are even more costly (as we
will show later), so the cost of the dict lookup is never evident in the
profiler.

Crossing the border between RPython and C
-----------------------------------------

There are two other things we need to care about whenever we cross the border
between RPython and C, and vice-versa: exception handling and the GIL.

In the C API, exceptions are raised by calling `PyErr_SetString()`_ (or one of
`many other functions`_ which have a similar effect), which basically works by
creating an exception value and storing it in some global variable. The
function then signals that an exception has occurred by returning an error value,
usually ``NULL``.

On the other hand, in the PyPy interpreter, exceptions are propagated by raising the
RPython-level OperationError_ exception, which wraps the actual app-level
exception values. To harmonize the two worlds, whenever we return from C to
RPython, we need to check whether a C API exception was raised and if so turn it
into an ``OperationError``.

We won't dig into details of `how the GIL is handled in cpyext`_.
For the purpose of this post, it is enough to know that whenever we enter
C land, we store the current thread id into a global variable which is
accessible also from C; conversely, whenever we go back from RPython to C, we
restore this value to 0.

Similarly, we need to do the inverse operations whenever you need to cross the
border between C and RPython, e.g. by calling a Python callback from C code.

All this complexity is automatically handled by the RPython function
`generic_cpy_call`_. If you look at the code you see that it takes care of 4
things:

  1. Handling the GIL as explained above.

  2. Handling exceptions, if they are raised.

  3. Converting arguments from ``W_Root`` to ``PyObject*``.

  4. Converting the return value from ``PyObject*`` to ``W_Root``.


So, we can see that calling C from RPython introduce some overhead.
Can we measure it?

Assuming that the conversion between ``W_Root`` and ``PyObject*`` has a
reasonable cost (as explained by the previous section), the overhead
introduced by a single border-cross is still acceptable, especially if the
callee is doing some non-negligible amount of work.

However this is not always the case. There are basically three problems that
make (or used to make) ``cpyext`` super slow:

  1. Paying the border-crossing cost for trivial operations which are called
     very often, such as ``Py_INCREF``.

  2. Crossing the border back and forth many times, even if it's not strictly
     needed.

  3. Paying an excessive cost for argument and return value conversions.


The next sections explain in more detail each of these problems.

Avoiding unnecessary roundtrips
--------------------------------

Prior to the `2017 Cape Town Sprint`_, ``cpyext`` was horribly slow, and we were
well aware of it: the main reason was that we never really paid too much
attention to performance. As explained in the blog post, emulating all the
CPython quirks is basically a nightmare, so better to concentrate on
correctness first.

However, we didn't really know **why** it was so slow. We had theories and
assumptions, usually pointing at the cost of conversions between ``W_Root``
and ``PyObject*``, but we never actually measured it.

So, we decided to write a set of `cpyext microbenchmarks`_ to measure the
performance of various operations.  The result was somewhat surprising: the
theory suggests that when you do a cpyext C call, you should pay the
border-crossing costs only once, but what the profiler told us was that we
were paying the cost of ``generic_cpy_call`` several times more than what we expected.

After a bit of investigation, we discovered this was ultimately caused by our
"correctness-first" approach. For simplicity of development and testing, when
we started ``cpyext`` we wrote everything in RPython: thus, every single API call
made from C (like the omnipresent `PyArg_ParseTuple()`_, `PyInt_AsLong()`_, etc.)
had to cross back the C-to-RPython border. This was especially daunting for
very simple and frequent operations like ``Py_INCREF`` and ``Py_DECREF``,
which CPython implements as a single assembly instruction!

Another source of slow down was the implementation of ``PyTypeObject`` slots.
At the C level, these are function pointers which the interpreter calls to do
certain operations, e.g. `tp_new`_ to allocate a new instance of that type.

As usual, we have some magic to implement slots in RPython; in particular,
`_make_wrapper`_ does the opposite of ``generic_cpy_call``: it takes a
RPython function and wraps it into a C function which can be safely called
from C, handling the GIL, exceptions and argument conversions automatically.

This was very handy during the development of cpyext, but it might result in
some bad nonsense; consider what happens when you call the following C
function:

.. sourcecode:: C

    static PyObject* foo(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)
    {
        PyObject* result = PyInt_FromLong(1234);
        return result;
    }

1. you are in RPython and do a cpyext call to ``foo``: **RPython-to-C**;

2. ``foo`` calls ``PyInt_FromLong(1234)``, which is implemented in RPython:
   **C-to-RPython**;

3. the implementation of ``PyInt_FromLong`` indirectly calls
   ``PyIntType.tp_new``, which is a C function pointer: **RPython-to-C**;

4. however, ``tp_new`` is just a wrapper around an RPython function, created
   by ``_make_wrapper``: **C-to-RPython**;

5. finally, we create our RPython ``W_IntObject(1234)``; at some point
   during the **RPython-to-C** crossing, its ``PyObject*`` equivalent is
   created;

6. after many layers of wrappers, we are again in ``foo``: after we do
   ``return result``, during the **C-to-RPython** step we convert it from
   ``PyObject*`` to ``W_IntObject(1234)``.

Phew! After we realized this, it was not so surprising that ``cpyext`` was very
slow :). And this was a simplified example, since we are not passing a
``PyObject*`` to the API call. When we do, we need to convert it back and
forth at every step.  Actually, I am not even sure that what I described was
the exact sequence of steps which used to happen, but you get the general
idea.

The solution is simple: rewrite as much as we can in C instead of RPython,
to avoid unnecessary roundtrips. This was the topic of most of the Cape Town
sprint and resulted in the ``cpyext-avoid-roundtrip`` branch, which was
eventually merged_.

Of course, it is not possible to move **everything** to C: there are still
operations which need to be implemented in RPython. For example, think of
``PyList_Append``: the logic to append an item to a list is complex and
involves list strategies, so we cannot replicate it in C.  However, we
discovered that a large subset of the C API can benefit from this.

Moreover, the C API is **huge**. While we invented this new way of writing
``cpyext`` code, we still need to
convert many of the functions to the new paradigm.  Sometimes the rewrite is
not automatic
or straighforward. ``cpyext`` is a delicate piece of software, so it happens often
that we make a mistake and end up staring at a segfault in gdb.

However, the most important takeaway is that the performance improvements we got
from this optimization are impressive, as we will detail later.

.. _merged: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/commits/7b550e9b3cee   


Conversion costs
----------------

The other potential big source of slowdown is the conversion of arguments
between ``W_Root`` and ``PyObject*``.

As explained earlier, the first time you pass a ``W_Root`` to C, you need to
allocate its ``PyObject*`` counterpart. Suppose you have a ``foo`` function
defined in C, which takes a single int argument:

.. sourcecode:: python

   for i in range(N):
       foo(i)

To run this code, you need to create a different ``PyObject*`` for each value
of ``i``: if implemented naively, it means calling ``N`` times ``malloc()``
and ``free()``, which kills performance.

CPython has the very same problem, which is solved by using a `free list`_ to
`allocate ints`_. So, what we did was to simply `steal the code`_ from CPython
and do the exact same thing. This was also done in the
``cpyext-avoid-roundtrip`` branch, and the benchmarks show that it worked
perfectly.

Every type which is converted often to ``PyObject*`` must have a very fast
allocator. At the moment of writing, PyPy uses free lists only for ints and
tuples_: one of the next steps on our TODO list is certainly to use this
technique with more types, like ``float``.

Conversely, we also need to optimize the converstion from ``PyObject*`` to
``W_Root``: this happens when an object is originally allocated in C and
returned to Python. Consider for example the following code:

.. sourcecode:: python

   import numpy as np
   myarray = np.random.random(N)
   for i in range(len(arr)):
       myarray[i]

At every iteration, we get an item out of the array: the return type is a an
instance of ``numpy.float64`` (a numpy scalar), i.e. a ``PyObject'*``: this is
something which is implemented by numpy entirely in C, so completely
opaque to ``cpyext``. We don't have any control on how it is allocated,
managed, etc., and we can assume that allocation costs are the same than on
CPython.

As soon as we return these ``PyObject*`` to Python, we need to allocate
their ``W_Root`` equivalent. If you do it in a small loop like in the example
above, you end up allocating all these ``W_Root`` inside the nursery, which is
a good thing since allocation is super fast (see the section above about the
PyPy GC).

However, we also need to keep track of the ``W_Root`` to ``PyObject*`` link.
Currently, we do this by putting all of them in a dictionary, but it is very
inefficient, especially because most of these objects die young and thus it
is wasted work to do that for them.  Currently, this is one of the biggest
unresolved problem in ``cpyext``, and it is what causes the two microbenchmarks
``allocate_int`` and ``allocate_tuple`` to be very slow.

We are well aware of the problem, and we have a plan for how to fix it. The
explanation is too technical for the scope of this blog post as it requires a
deep knowledge of the GC internals to be understood, but the details are
here_.

C API quirks
------------

Finally, there is another source of slowdown which is beyond our control. Some
parts of the CPython C API are badly designed and expose some of the
implementation details of CPython.

The major example is reference counting. The ``Py_INCREF`` / ``Py_DECREF`` API
is designed in such a way which forces other implementation to emulate
refcounting even in presence of other GC management schemes, as explained
above.

Another example is borrowed references. There are API functions which **do
not** incref an object before returning it, e.g. `PyList_GetItem()`_.  This is
done for performance reasons because we can avoid a whole incref/decref pair,
if the caller needs to handle the returned item only temporarily: the item is
kept alive because it is in the list anyway.

For PyPy, this is a challenge: thanks to `list strategies`_, lists are often
represented in a compact way. For example, a list containing only integers is
stored as a C array of ``long``.  How to implement ``PyList_GetItem``? We
cannot simply create a ``PyObject*`` on the fly, because the caller will never
decref it and it will result in a memory leak.

The current solution is very inefficient. The first time we do a
``PyList_GetItem``, we convert_ the **whole** list to a list of
``PyObject*``. This is bad in two ways: the first is that we potentially pay a
lot of unneeded conversion cost in case we will never access the other items
of the list. The second is that by doing that we lose all the performance
benefit granted by the original list strategy, making it slower for the
rest of the pure-python code which will manipulate the list later.

``PyList_GetItem`` is an example of a bad API because it assumes that the list
is implemented as an array of ``PyObject*``: after all, in order to return a
borrowed reference, we need a reference to borrow, don't we?

Fortunately, (some) CPython developers are aware of these problems, and there
is an ongoing project to `design a better C API`_ which aims to fix exactly
this kind of problem.

Nonetheless, in the meantime we still need to implement the current
half-broken APIs. There is no easy solution for that, and it is likely that
we will always need to pay some performance penalty in order to implement them
correctly.

However, what we could potentially do is to provide alternative functions
which do the same job but are more PyPy friendly: for example, we could think
of implementing ``PyList_GetItemNonBorrowed`` or something like that: then, C
extensions could choose to use it (possibly hidden inside some macro and
``#ifdef``) if they want to be fast on PyPy.

Current performance
-------------------

During the whole blog post we claimed ``cpyext`` is slow. How
slow it is, exactly?

We decided to concentrate on microbenchmarks_ for now. It should be evident
by now there are simply too many issues which can slow down a ``cpyext``
program, and microbenchmarks help us to concentrate on one (or few) at a
time.

The microbenchmarks measure very simple things, like calling functions and
methods with the various calling conventions (no arguments, one arguments,
multiple arguments); passing various types as arguments (to measure conversion
costs); allocating objects from C, and so on.

Here are the results from the old PyPy 5.8 relative and normalized to CPython
2.7, the lower the better:

.. image:: pypy58.png

PyPy was horribly slow everywhere, ranging from 2.5x to 10x slower. It is
particularly interesting to compare ``simple.noargs``, which measures the cost
of calling an empty function with no arguments, and ``simple.onearg(i)``,
which measures the cost calling an empty function passing an integer argument:
the latter is ~2x slower than the former, indicating that the conversion cost
of integers is huge.

PyPy 5.8 was the last release before the famous Cape Town sprint, when we
started to look at cpyext performance seriously. Here are the performance data for
PyPy 6.0, the latest release at the time of writing:

.. image:: pypy60.png

The results are amazing! PyPy is now massively faster than before, and for
most benchmarks it is even faster than CPython: yes, you read it correctly:
PyPy is faster than CPython at doing CPython's job, even considering all the
extra work it has to do to emulate the C API.  This happens thanks to the JIT,
which produces speedups high enough to counterbalance the slowdown caused by
cpyext.

There are two microbenchmarks which are still slower though: ``allocate_int``
and ``allocate_tuple``, for the reasons explained in the section about
`Conversion costs`_.

.. _microbenchmarks: https://github.com/antocuni/cpyext-benchmarks


Next steps
----------

Despite the spectacular results we got so far, ``cpyext`` is still slow enough to
kill performance in most real-world code which uses C extensions extensively
(e.g., the omnipresent numpy).

Our current approach is something along these lines:

    1. run a real-world small benchmark which exercises cpyext

    2. measure and find the major bottleneck

    3. write a corresponding microbenchmark

    4. optimize it

    5. repeat

On one hand, this is a daunting task because the C API is huge and we need to
tackle functions one by one.  On the other hand, not all the functions are
equally important, and is is enough to optimize a relatively small subset to
improve many different use cases.

Where a year ago we announced we have a working answer to run c-extension in
PyPy, we now have a clear picture of what are the performance bottlenecks, and
we have developed some technical solutions to fix them. It is "only" a matter
of tackling them, one by one.  It is worth noting that most of the work was
done during two sprints, for a total 2-3 person-months of work.


We think this work is important for the Python ecosystem. PyPy has established
a baseline for performance in pure python code, providing an answer for the
"Python is slow" detractors. The techniques used to make ``cpyext`` performant
will let PyPy become an alternative for people who mix C extensions with
Python, which, it turns out, is just about everyone, in particular those using
the various scientific libraries. Today, many developers are forced to seek
performance by converting code from Python to a lower language. We feel there
is no reason to do this, but in order to prove it we must be able to run both
their python and their C extensions performantly, then we can begin to educate
them how to write JIT-friendly code in the first place.

We envision a future in which you can run arbitrary Python programs on PyPy,
with the JIT speeding up the pure Python parts and the C parts running as fast
as today: the best of both worlds!
