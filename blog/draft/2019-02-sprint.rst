Düsseldorf sprint report

Hello everyone!

We are happy to report a successful and well attended sprint that is wrapping up
in Düsseldorf, Germany. In the last week we had eighteen people sprinting at the
Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf on various topics. Big chunk of the sprint
was dedicated to various discussions, since we did not manage to gather
core developers in one room in quite a while. Discussion topics included:

* Funding and general sustainability of open source.

* Catching up with CPython 3.7/3.8 - we are planning to release 3.6 some time
  in the next few months and we will continue working on 3.7/3.8.

* What to do with VMprof

* How can we support Cython inside PyPy in a way that will be understood
  by the JIT, hence fast.

* The future of supporting the numeric stack on pypy - we have made significant
  progress in the past few years and most of numeric stack works out of the box,
  but deployment and performance remain problems. Improving on those problems
  remain a very important focus for pypy as a project.

* Using the presence of CPython developer (Łukasz Langa) and Graal python developer
  (Tim Felgentreff) we discussed ways to collaborate in order to improve python
  ecosystem across implementations.

* Pierre-Yves David and Georges Racinet from octobus gave us an exciting demo
  on `Heptapod`_, which adds mercurial support to gitlab.

Some highlights of the coding tasks worked on:

* Aarch64 (ARM64) JIT backend work has been started, we are able to run the first
  test! Tobias Oberstein from Crossbar GmbH and Rodolph Perfetta from ARM joined the
  sprint to help kickstart the project.

* Long running math-improvements branch that was started by Stian Andreassen got merged
  after bugfixes done by Alexander Schremmer. It should improve operations on large integers.

* Arcane art of necromancy was used to revive long dormant regalloc branch started
  and nearly finished by Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick. The branch got merged and gives
  some modest speedups across the board.

* Andrew Lawrence worked on MSI installer for PyPy on windows.

* Łukasz worked on improving failing tests on PyPy 3.6 branch. He knows very obscure
  details of CPython, hence we managed to progress very quickly on the 3.6 branch.

* Matti Picus set up new benchmarking server for PyPy 3 branches.

* Utf8 branch, which changes the internal representation of unicode might be finally
  merged at some point very soon. That gives significant speedups in a lot of cases
  handling strings.

* Zlib was missing couple methods, which were added by Ronan Lamy and Julian Berman.

* Manuel Jacob fixed RevDB failures.

* Antonio Cuni and Matti Picus worked on 7.0 release which should happen in a few days.

Best regards,
Maciej Fijałkowski, Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick and the whole PyPy team.
