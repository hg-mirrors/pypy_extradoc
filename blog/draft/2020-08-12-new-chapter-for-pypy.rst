A new chapter for PyPy
======================

*PyPy winds down its membership in the Software Freedom Conservancy*

Conservancy and PyPy's great work together
------------------------------------------

PyPy_ joined Conservancy_ in the `second half of 2010`_, shortly after the
release of PyPy 1.2, the first version to contain a fully functional JIT.
`In 2013`_, PyPy started supporting ARM, bringing its just-in-time speediness to
many more devices and began working toward supporting NumPy to help
scientists crunch their numbers faster. Together, PyPy and Conservancy ran
successful fundraising drives and facilitated payment and oversight for
`contractors and code sprints`_.

Conservancy supported PyPy's impressive growth as it expanded support for
different hardware platforms, greating improved the performance of C extensions,
and added support for Python 3 as the language itself evolved.

The road ahead
--------------

Conservancy provides a fiscal and organizational home for projects that find the
freedoms and guardrails that come along with a charitable home advantageous for
their community goals. While this framework was a great fit for the early PyPy
community, times change and all good things must come to an end.

PyPy will remain free software, but the community's structure and organizational
underpinnings will be changing and the PyPy community will be exploring options
outside of the charitable realm for its next phase of growth.

During the last year PyPy and Conservancy have worked together to properly
utilise the generous donations made by stalwart PyPy enthusiats over the years
and to wrap up PyPy's remaining charitable obligations. PyPy is grateful for
the Conservancy's help in shepherding the project toward its next chapter.

Thank yous
----------

  "We are happy that Conservancy was able to help PyPy bring important software
  for the public good during a critical time in its history. We wish the
  community well and look forward to seeing it develop and succeed in new ways."
  -- Karen Sandler, Conservancy's Executive Director

PyPy would like to thank Conservancy for their decade long support in building
the community and wishes Conservancy continued success in their journey
promoting, improving, developing and defending free and open source sofware.
