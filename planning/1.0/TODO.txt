pending issues 
-----------------------------

  - ensure working Interpreter translation combinations: 
    - pypy-c-stackless/tp/taint/jit/GC-framework/thunk
    - pypy-cli-tp/taint/thunk

    - (done) make a matrix of possible combinations (wp13-report) (cfbolz) 

  - complete/debug jit on powerpc (mwh)
    (basically done) somewhat working, debugging in progress

  - (mostly done) debug jit on intel (arigo/pedronis/arre)
    in progress, --jit --faassen works now, "is_true" issue fixed 

  - integrate and test: 
    - (done) wp10 - basically complete, pending issues brought up in review
    - (almost done) wp08 code 
    - (arigo,pedronis,arre): docs & examples, getting-started 
    - wp09 docs, examples and code - maybe what we have is good enough?
      (christian looking into this currently) a bit of progress, 
      but no feedback/interaction with DFKI/Danish yet. 

  - revisit entry level docs (architecture, mission, getting-started)
    - terminology clarifications:
      - use "translating PYPY interpreters" or "translating
        standard interpreter" instead of talking about
        e.g. "translating the whole of pypy"
      - VM translation framework 
      - so we have: 
        - pypy standard interpreter (easy to understand/modify)
        - pypy VM translation framework (neccessarily more complex)
    (hpk to start here, have something done by friday)

  - describe particularly Javascript-related demos, refine them. 
    (mostly done, apart from 404/500 pages and possible JIT demo) 
    It's all more or less done. What needs to be done (play1):
    - more examples with autopaste feature
    - source code of web page under the button?
    - refined help
    - make nice 404 and 500 pages, also for apache
    - make pypy-cli work there
    - discuss/do a JIT demo
    (fijal)

  - (done, still a bit of doc's/demo refinements maybe) 
     make transparent proxies more prominent 
     because they are a rather powerful feature)
    - write a nice support module (pypy/lib/tputil.py - in progress)
    - write/review documentation (in-progress)
    - fix bugs if any
    (hpk, still a bit of doc's/demo refinements)

  - update wp6 docs (object-optimizations.txt) and link
    to them from getting-started (mwh to coordinate)
    ropes docs added

  - (done) document build tool usages (getting-started?), connect servers with it
  - stress-test/use buildtool for translation tests (multicompile) 
    (guido_w)

  - (DONE) consider where/how to put special builtins ("pypymagic"
    might not be a good name), suggestions: 
    - names: not pypymagic, not pypybuiltin, holger and cf to propose
      (done, result is __pypy__)
    - document pypybuiltin module (add docstrings) (done)
    - functions should only be there if the according option
      is enabled (e.g. method cache) (done)
    - functions only relating to py.py should not appear in
      translated version (unless they work :) (done)
    (cfbolz)

  - (no news ) include documentation/entry point for 
    the JS interpreter (santagada, fijal) 

  - include documentation/entry point for 
    the prolog interpreter (cfbolz, maybe)
