   release status / remaining tasks                    (14.5, 11.1)
   dist-trunk separation (possibly restricting
   permissions for release candidates)

pending issues 
-----------------------------

  - ensure working Interpreter translation combinations: 
    - pypy-c-stackless/tp/taint/jit/GC-framework/thunk
    - pypy-cli-tp/taint/thunk

    - (done) make a matrix of possible combinations (wp13-report) (cfbolz) 

  - complete/debug jit on powerpc (mwh)
    (basically done) somewhat working, debugging in progress

  - (mostly done) debug jit on intel (arigo/pedronis/arre)
    in progress, --jit --faassen works now, "is_true" issue fixed 

  - integrate and test: 
    - (done) wp10 - basically complete, pending issues brought up in review
    - (almost done) wp08 code 
    - (arigo,pedronis,arre): docs & examples, getting-started 
    - wp09 docs, examples and code - maybe what we have is good enough?
      (christian looking into this currently) a bit of progress, 
      but no feedback/interaction with DFKI/Danish yet. 

  - revisit entry level docs (architecture, mission, getting-started)
    - review entry points from the play1 demos. 

    - review/refactor architecture.txt:
      - mission statement should emphasize VM
        framework/translation and not mention project results 
      - always clearly separate the talk about the VM translation 
        framework and the Python implementation (and its features) 
        for example "PyPy - implementation of python in python" 
        as the first title is misleading.  maybe something like: 
        a) PyPy is a VM/VHLL translation framework (or whatever we settle on)
        b) already contains a full Python implementation
           part of which is re-used from the translation framework 
           to analyse RPython programs (abstract interpretation ...)
      - make the descriptions more "future" proof, i.e. 
        not reflecting the current state, possibly shortening
      - check other entry level docs (also FAQ) for keeping to this
        updated view 

      rationale for looking in more depth at architecture.txt: 
      this document and getting-started.txt document are
      the most viewed (arch: 1500 times in march, getting-started: 
      around 2200 times) ones and people expect archictecture.txt
      to reflect our view on the project. 

  - describe particularly Javascript-related demos, refine them. 
    (mostly done, apart from 404/500 pages and possible JIT demo) 
  - fix play1 issues: 
    - source code of web page under the button?
    - review/refine help (add examples where necessary)
    - make nice 404 and 500 pages, also for apache
    - fix linking (it gets easily confused if you click around) 
    - discuss/do a JIT demo
    (fijal)

  - (done, still a bit of doc's/demo refinements maybe) 
     make transparent proxies more prominent 
     because they are a rather powerful feature)
    - write a nice support module (pypy/lib/tputil.py - in progress)
    - write/review documentation (in-progress)
    - fix bugs if any
    (hpk) 

  - update wp6 docs (object-optimizations.txt) and link
    to them from getting-started (mwh to coordinate)
    ropes docs added

  - (done) document build tool usages (getting-started?), connect servers with it
  - stress-test/use buildtool for translation tests (multicompile) 
    (guido_w)

  - (DONE) consider where/how to put special builtins ("pypymagic"
    might not be a good name), suggestions: 
    - names: not pypymagic, not pypybuiltin, holger and cf to propose
      (done, result is __pypy__)
    - document pypybuiltin module (add docstrings) (done)
    - functions should only be there if the according option
      is enabled (e.g. method cache) (done)
    - functions only relating to py.py should not appear in
      translated version (unless they work :) (done)
    (cfbolz)

  - (no news ) include documentation/entry point for 
    the JS interpreter (santagada, fijal) 

  - include documentation/entry point for 
    the prolog interpreter (cfbolz, maybe)
