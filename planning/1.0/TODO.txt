pending issues 
-----------------------------

  - ensure working Interpreter translation combinations: 
    - test various config option configurations -- use build tool? (guido)
    - test windows situation (antocuni, fijal) -- seems generally good

  - integrate and test: 
    - (arigo,pedronis,arre): wp08 docs & examples, getting-started 
    - wp09 docs, examples and code - maybe what we have is good enough?
      (christian looking into this currently) a bit of progress, 
      but no feedback/interaction with DFKI/Danish yet. 

  - revisit entry level docs (architecture, mission, getting-started)
    - (guido,hpk) review entry points from the play1 demos. 
    - (hpk, ...) review/refactor architecture.txt -- see docs-refactoring.txt
    
  - describe particularly Javascript-related demos, refine them. 
    (mostly done, apart from 404/500 pages and possible JIT demo) 
  - fix play1 issues: 
    - source code of web page under the button?
    - review/refine help (add examples where necessary)
    - make nice 404 and 500 pages, also for apache
    - fix linking (it gets easily confused if you click around) 
    - discuss/do a JIT demo
    (fijal)

  - update wp6 docs (object-optimizations.txt) and link
    to them from getting-started (mwh to coordinate)
    ropes docs added

  - (guido) connect more servers to buildtool if possible 
  - stress-test/use buildtool for translation tests (multicompile) 
    (guido_w)

  - (no news ) include documentation/entry point for 
    the JS interpreter (santagada, fijal) 

  - include documentation/entry point for 
    the prolog interpreter (cfbolz, maybe) 



NOTES AND DONE TASKS 
-----------------------------

  - (DONE) consider where/how to put special builtins ("pypymagic"
    might not be a good name), suggestions: 
    - names: not pypymagic, not pypybuiltin, holger and cf to propose
      (done, result is __pypy__)
    - document pypybuiltin module (add docstrings) (done)
    - functions should only be there if the according option
      is enabled (e.g. method cache) (done)
    - functions only relating to py.py should not appear in
      translated version (unless they work :) (done)
    (cfbolz)

  - (done, still a bit of doc's/demo refinements maybe) 
     make transparent proxies more prominent 
     because they are a rather powerful feature)
    - write a nice support module (pypy/lib/tputil.py - in progress)
    - write/review documentation (in-progress)
    - fix bugs if any
    (hpk) 

    - (done) wp10 - basically complete, pending issues brought up in review
    - (done) wp08 code 

  - (done) make a matrix of possible combinations (wp13-report) (cfbolz) 

  - complete/debug jit on powerpc 
    (basically done) somewhat working

  - (done for release) debug jit on intel (arigo/pedronis/arre)
    appears to work well, gives nice speedups on suitably contrived examples

  - (done) document build tool usages (getting-started?)
