pending issues 
-----------------------------

  - ensure working Interpreter translation combinations: 
    - test various config option configurations -- use build tool? (guido)
    - test windows situation (antocuni, fijal) -- seems generally good

  - integrate and test: 
    - (arigo,pedronis,arre, IN-PROGRESS): wp08 docs & examples, getting-started 
    - (cfbolz) test wp09 getting-started examples: 
      - after some fixing things seem to work
    - wp09 docs, examples and code - maybe what we have is good enough?
      (christian looking into this currently) a bit of progress, 
      but no feedback/interaction with DFKI/Danish yet. 

  - (arigo,cfbolz,pedronis) review/refactor new-architecture.txt 
    
  - (done) update wp6 docs (interpreter-optimizations.txt) and link
    to them from getting-started (mwh to coordinate)
    ropes docs added

  - (guido) possibly connect more servers to buildtool 
  - stress-test/use buildtool for translation tests (multicompile) 
    (guido_w)

  - (cfbolz, in-progress) include documentation/entry point for 
    the prolog interpreter 

  - move pedronis/pypy-c-testing, pedronis/tarball-testing 
    and pypy/tool/build all into 
        
        http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/build

    directory and arigo's htmlconftest as a snapshot or external. 
    refactor docs to point to the tools correctly
    (build/bin/* probably) 

  - play1 additional features (fijal)
    - add cli examples
    - review
    - (maybe) add a distribution demo
    - (probably not) add a prolog function-pasting stuff

  - getting-started links and version numbers

  - update README, also link and version numbers!

  - (pedronis, in-progress) tarball packaging and testing 
    - what is missing (code-wise) for a release candidate? 

    - when to do the release candidate? 
    - skip some weakref tests related to missing GC refactorings 
      for 1.0? 

  - (pedronis,hpk, review from cfbolz and NN)
    write release announcement 


NOTES AND DONE TASKS 
-----------------------------

  - (done by NNN: fijal, NNN) play1 issues: 
    - rebuild pypy's to use the new readline stub (fixing 
      ugly stdout/stdin interactions) 
    - review/refine help (add examples where necessary)
    - make examples execute more cleanly
    - fix linking (it gets easily confused if you click around), 
      make correct 404 and 500 pages
    - discuss/do a JIT demo

  - (DROPPED for 1.0) include documentation/entry point for 
    the JS interpreter (santagada, fijal) 


  - (hpk, guido, DONE) review entry points from the play1 demos. 

  - (DONE), arigo,pedronis,hpk) fix test failures of translated PyPys 
    related to aop.py module modifying global compiler state and
    subsequent tests randomly breaking 


  - (DONE) consider where/how to put special builtins ("pypymagic"
    might not be a good name), suggestions: 
    - names: not pypymagic, not pypybuiltin, holger and cf to propose
      (done, result is __pypy__)
    - document pypybuiltin module (add docstrings) (done)
    - functions should only be there if the according option
      is enabled (e.g. method cache) (done)
    - functions only relating to py.py should not appear in
      translated version (unless they work :) (done)
    (cfbolz)

  - (done, still a bit of doc's/demo refinements maybe) 
     make transparent proxies more prominent 
     because they are a rather powerful feature)
    - write a nice support module (pypy/lib/tputil.py - in progress)
    - write/review documentation (in-progress)
    - fix bugs if any
    (hpk) 

    - (done) wp10 - basically complete, pending issues brought up in review
    - (done) wp08 code 

  - (done) make a matrix of possible combinations (wp13-report) (cfbolz) 

  - complete/debug jit on powerpc 
    (basically done) somewhat working

  - (done for release) debug jit on intel (arigo/pedronis/arre)
    appears to work well, gives nice speedups on suitably contrived examples

  - (done) document build tool usages (getting-started?)

  - (DONE, arigo) fix bad terminal behaviour of translated PyPy's 

    (contributing to play1 quirks)
