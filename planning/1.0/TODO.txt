pending issues 
-----------------------------

  - ensure working Interpreter translation combinations: 
    - pypy-c-stackless/tp/taint/jit/GC-framework/thunk
    - pypy-cli-tp/taint/thunk

    - make a matrix of possible combinations (wp13-report)
      (cfbolz)

  - complete/debug jit on powerpc (mwh)

  - debug jit on intel (arigo/pedronis/arre)
    in progress, fixing bugs and improving "is_true" jitting 
 

  - integrate and test: 
    - wp10 
      - docs, examples (done) 
      - fixing "weaver" bugs (agurney)
    - wp08 docs, examples and code (arigo/pedronis/arre, after debugging)
    - wp09 docs, examples and code - maybe what we have is good enough?
      (christian looking into this currently)

  - revisit entry level docs (architecture, mission, getting-started)
    - terminology clarifications:
      - use "translating PYPY interpreters" or "translating
        standard interpreter" instead of talking about
        e.g. "translating the whole of pypy"
      - VM translation framework 
      - so we have: 
        - pypy standard interpreter (easy to understand/modify)
        - pypy VM translation framework (neccessarily more complex)
    (hpk to start here)

  - describe particularly Javascript-related demos, refine them. 
    bring play1.codespeak.net online (in-progress) 
    (in-progress, adding more console variations currently, nicer entry page) 
    (fijal)

  - make transparent proxies more prominent 
    (because they are a rather powerful feature)
    - write a nice support module (pypy/lib/tputil.py - in progress)
    - write/review documentation (in-progress)
    - fix bugs if any
    - probably don't go for "transparent_proxy(type, ...)" :) 
    (hpk)

  - update wp6 docs (object-optimizations.txt) and link
    to them from getting-started (mwh to coordinate)

  - document build tool usages (getting-started?), connect servers with it
    (guido_w)

  - consider where/how to put special builtins ("pypymagic"
    might not be a good name), suggestions: 
    - names: pypybuiltin? decide about name at pypy-sync wednesday 
    - document pypybuiltin module (add docstrings)
    - functions should only be there if the according option
      is enabled (e.g. method cache) 
    - options only relating to py.py should not appear in
      translated version (unless they work :) 
    (cfbolz)

  - include documentation/entry point for 
    the JS interpreter (santagada, fijal)
