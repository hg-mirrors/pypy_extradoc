Documentation for release 1.0
================================


index.txt: reorder the categories:

   * Meta-Documentation (about PyPy, coding, talks, etc.)

   * User Documentation (for the PyPy user): getting started,
     how to translate, and new Python features

   * Status

   * Source Code Documentation,
     ending with directory cross-reference


config pages, for all the options.
Link to the other pages as much as possible.


pypy.net      - also update translation.txt


js backend    - is there something to update in translation.txt?


object-optimizations.txt.  I guess we take text from the EU report.

   * transparent proxies

   * security prototype

   * thunk space (move from objspace.txt)


jit.txt: copy introduction from pypy-dev e-mail, add examples of nice colors
