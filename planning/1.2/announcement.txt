Introducing PyPy 1.2 release
============================

We are pleased to announce PyPy's 1.2 release.
This 1.2 is a major milestone and it is
the first release to ship a `Just in time compiler`_ that is known to speed
up some real-world python programs. The main theme for the 1.2 release is
**speed**.

The JIT is stable and we don't observe crashes.
Nevertheless we would recommend you to
treat it as beta software and as a way to try the JIT out to see how it
works for you.

Highlights:

* JIT compiler.

* Various interpreter optimizations that improve performance as well as help
  save memory. Read our `various`_ `blog`_ `posts`_ about achievements.

* Introducing a `new PyPy website`_ made by `tav`_ and improved by the PyPy
  team.

* Introducing `speed.pypy.org`_, a new service that monitors our performance
  nightly.

* Introducing Ubuntu packages on `PPA`_, done by `Bartosz Skowron`_.

Known JIT problems (or why you should consider this beta software):

* Only 32bit x86 for now, we're looking for help with other platforms.

* It is still memory-hungry.  There is no limit on the amount of RAM that
  the assembler can consume; it is thus possible (although unlikely) that
  the assembler ends up using unreasonable amounts of memory.

If you want to try PyPy, go to `download page`_ on our excellent new site
and find the binary for your platform. If the binary does not work (e.g. on
Linux, because of different versions of external .so dependencies), or if
your platform is not supported, you can `try building from the source`_.

PyPy release team,
XXX folks
