Introducing PyPy 1.2 release
============================

We're pleased to announce PyPy's 1.2 release. 1.2 is a major milestone and it's
the first release to ship a `Just in time compiler`_ that is known to speed
up some real-world python programs. The main theme for the 1.2 release is
**speed**.

While the JIT is stable and we don't observe crashes, we would recommend
treating it as beta software and as a way to try the JIT out to see how it
works for you.

Highlights:

* JIT compiler.

* Various interpreter optimizations that improve performance as well as help
  save memory. Read our `various`_ `blog`_ `posts`_ about achievments.

* Introducing a `new PyPy website`_ made by `tav`_ and improved by the PyPy
  team.

* Introducing `speed.pypy.org`_, a new service that monitors our performance
  nightly.

* Introducing ubuntu packages on `PPA`_.

Known JIT problems (or why you should consider this beta software):

* Only 32bit x86 for now, we're looking for help with other platforms.

* There is no limit to amount of RAM assembler can consume, it's possible
  (although unlikely) to consume your whole memory.
