==========================================
Differences between releases 1.4 and 1.4.1
==========================================


* In long-running processes, the assembler generated by old JIT-compilations
  is now freed.  There should be no more leak, however long the process runs.

* Improve the performance of the ``binascii`` module, and of ``hashlib.md5``
  and ``hashlib.sha``.

* Fix a corner case in the GC (minimark).

* Fix cpyext on Mac OS X.  (Loading C extension modules in PyPy is still
  considered *alpha stage!*)

* Fixed a corner case in the JIT, leading to "Fatal RPython error:
  AssertionError".

* Added some missing functions from the 'os' module.


Plan:

* Out of line guards (?)

* Merge jit-unroll-loops (?)

* Migrate to mercurial

* Finish looking in the ctypes bug::

    c = cast(cast(c_char_p("hello"), c_void_p), c_char_p)
    gc.collect()
    c.value       # garbage
