==========================================
Differences between releases 1.4 and 1.4.1
==========================================

Migrated to mercurial.

Note: pypy's performance was optimized almost exclusively on
Linux.  It seems from some reports that on Windows as well as Mac
OS X (probably for different reasons) the performance might be
lower.  We did not investigate much so far.


* In long-running processes, the assembler generated by old JIT-compilations
  is now freed.  There should be no more leak, however long the process runs.

* Improve the performance of the ``binascii`` module, and of ``hashlib.md5``
  and ``hashlib.sha``.

* Fix argument processing (now e.g. ``pypy -OScpass`` works like
  it does on CPython --- if you have a clue what it does there ``:-)`` )

* Fix cpyext on Mac OS X.  (Loading C extension modules in PyPy is still
  considered *alpha stage!*)

* Fix two corner cases in the GC (one in minimark, one in asmgcc+JIT).
  This notably prevented "pypy translate.py -Ojit" from working on Windows,
  leading to crashes.

* Fixed a corner case in the JIT's optimizer, leading to "Fatal RPython
  error: AssertionError".

* Added some missing built-in functions into the 'os' module.

* Fix ctypes (it was not propagating keepalive information from c_void_p).

* Made sys.setrecursionlimit() a no-op.
  Instead, we rely purely on the built-in stack overflow detection mechanism,
  which also gives you a RuntimeError -- just not at some exact recursion
  level.
