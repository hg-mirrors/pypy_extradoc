==========================================
Differences between releases 1.4 and 1.4.1
==========================================


* In long-running processes, the assembler generated by old JIT-compilations
  is now freed.  There should be no more leak, however long the process runs.

* Improve the performance of the ``binascii`` module, and of ``hashlib.md5``
  and ``hashlib.sha``.

* Fix two corner cases in the GC (one in minimark, one in asmgcc+JIT).

* Fix cpyext on Mac OS X.  (Loading C extension modules in PyPy is still
  considered *alpha stage!*)

* Fixed a corner case in the JIT's optimizer, leading to "Fatal RPython
  error: AssertionError".

* Added some missing functions from the 'os' module.

* Fix ctypes (it was not propagating keepalive information from c_void_p).


Plan:

* Out of line guards (?) -> after the release

* Merge jit-unroll-loops (?) -> after the release

* Migrate to mercurial -> should not be a blocker

* Understand what's going on on Windows with pypy-c translate.py -Ojit

* finish the removal of sys.setrecursionlimit()
