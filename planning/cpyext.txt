- BaseCpyTypedescr.allocate() calls
  lltype.malloc(add_memory_pressure=True).  We should reduce the memory
  pressure in case a DECREF() frees the object before it becomes
  attached to a W_Root object.


- make_typedescr() for the type object (typeobject.py) should pass
  basestruct=PyHeapTypeObject??
