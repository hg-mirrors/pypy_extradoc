- BaseCpyTypedescr.allocate() calls
  lltype.malloc(add_memory_pressure=True).  We should reduce the memory
  pressure in case a DECREF() frees the object before it becomes
  attached to a W_Root object.


- make sure that we run all tests with -A, too

- make PyTypeObject be a pointer, like all other PyXxxObject

- as_pyobj() should be a context manager which calls
  keepalive_until_here()

- tupleobject.c: PyErr_BadInternalCall() and PyErr_NoMemory()
  cannot be called from PyTuple_New() right now, think again

- methodobject.py: be ready for make_ref() to fail, and free the
  partially-contructed tuple (same logic as tuple_attach)

- add JIT support to virtualize the pypy side placeholders of PyObject*: this
  way, if a PyObject* is converted to W_Root only for the lifetime of the
  loop, we can avoid the cost entirely
