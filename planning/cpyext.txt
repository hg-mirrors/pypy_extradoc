- BaseCpyTypedescr.allocate() calls
  lltype.malloc(add_memory_pressure=True).  We should reduce the memory
  pressure in case a DECREF() frees the object before it becomes
  attached to a W_Root object.


- make_typedescr() for the type object (typeobject.py) should pass
  basestruct=PyHeapTypeObject??

- make sure that we run all tests with -A, too

- make PyTypeObject be a pointer, like all other PyXxxObject

- as_pyobj() should be a context manager which calls
  keepalive_until_here()

- tupleobject.c: PyErr_BadInternalCall() and PyErr_NoMemory()
  cannot be called from PyTuple_New() right now, think again

- methodobject.py: be ready for make_ref() to fail, and free the
  partially-contructed tuple (same logic as tuple_attach)
