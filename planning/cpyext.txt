- BaseCpyTypedescr.allocate() calls
  lltype.malloc(add_memory_pressure=True).  We should reduce the memory
  pressure in case a DECREF() frees the object before it becomes
  attached to a W_Root object.


- make_typedescr() for the type object (typeobject.py) should pass
  basestruct=PyHeapTypeObject??

- right now the conversion from space.w_None to Py_None always does a dict
  lookup (inside as_pyobj); investigate whether it is worth to add a special
  case for it. A possible more general solution is to add a special field to
  some selected W_* classes (for example W_TypeObject, W_NoneObject and an
  hypotetical W_CPyObject) which contains a PyObject* field, so that doing the
  w_* -> py_* lookup is just a getfield (there is alreadt support for this in
  rawrefcount.create_link_pyobj)
