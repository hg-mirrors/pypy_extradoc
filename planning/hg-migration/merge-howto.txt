How to merge existing SVN branches in mercurial
================================================

This document applies to branches that:

  1. already existed in svn before the mercurial migration

  2. contains one or more "merge from trunk" done in svn

If the branch does not contain any "merge from trunk", the merging should be
straightforward (i.e., you just get "real" conflicts).

The problem with "merge from trunk" is that mercurial does not know that we
have already applied a set of changes in our branch, so it tries to redo them
(plus all the other changes that were done on trunk) and we get false
conflicts.

To solve, we need to explicitly tell mercurial that trunk has already been
merged into our branch up to the right revision:

  1. first of all, we need to find the SVN revision which contains the last
     merge from trunk: when doing the actual merge, mercurial will apply only
     the changes that happened on trunk from this point on. Let's call it
     ``SR`` (Svn Revision).

  2. we need to find the mercurial node that corresponds to ``SR``: see the
     next section for how to do it. Let's call it ``HR`` (Hg Revision)

  3. switch to the branch in mercurial::
         $ hg up -r my-branch

  4. perform a "dummy merge": this just tells mercurial that all the changes
     up to revision ``HR`` has been already merged into the branch::
         $ hg --config ui.merge=internal:local merge HR

  5. update to ``default`` (i.e., the equivalent of svn trunk) and merge the branch::
         $ hg up -r default
         $ hg merge my-branch
         $ hg ci -m 'merged my-branch'

How to find the ``HR`` corresponding to ``SR``
----------------------------------------------

If we want to do it manually, we can use this command::

    $ hg log --template '{node|short} {extras}\n' | less

This will print a line for each changeset, showing the mercurial hash and a
string which among other things contains the SVN revision. We want to pick the
changeset with the highest svn revision number which is less than the target
``SR``.

Alternatively, we can use the svnup_ mercurial extension. We need to put these
lines into ``~/.hgrc``::

    [extensions]
    svnup = /path/to/svnup.py

Then, we can just use the ``svnfind`` command to find the changeset we are looking for::

    $ hg svnfind -r 79389
    changeset:   39199:f96e54f36e15
