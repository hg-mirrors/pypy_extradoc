release management: 
   michael?, holger?, from 23rd: +samuele, +arigo 
   
release content: 
  - ensure working Interpreter translation combinations: 
    - pypy-c-stackless/tp/taint/jit/GC-framework/thunk
    - pypy-cli-tp/taint/thunk
    - make a matrix of possible combinations (wp13-report)

  - integrate and test: 
    wp10 docs, examples and code   
    wp08 docs, examples and code 
    (wp09 docs, examples and code - maybe what we have is good enough?)

  - revisit entry level docs (architecture, mission, getting-started)
    - terminology clarifications:
      - use "translating PYPY interpreters" or "translating
        standard interpreter" instead of talking about
        e.g. "translating the whole of pypy"
      - VM translation framework 
      - so we have: 
        - pypy standard interpreter (easy to understand/modify)
        - pypy VM translation framework (neccessarily more complex)

  - describe particularly Javascript-related demos, refine them. 
    (revisit play1.codespeak.net) 

  - make transparent proxies more prominent 
    (because they are a rather powerful feature)
    - write a nice support module 
    - write/review documentation 
    - fix bugs if any
    - probably don't go for "transparent_proxy(type, ...)" :) 

  - update wp6 docs (object-optimizations.txt) and link
    to them from getting-started 

  - document build tool usages (getting-started?), connect servers with it

  - refactor and _document_ pypy special info/features to be in 
    sys.pypy.version_info *
    sys.pypy.translation_options *

    consider where/how to put special builtins ("pypymagic"
    might not be a good name), suggestions: 
    - names: pypybuiltin or maybe sys.pypy.* 
    - document pypybuiltin module
    - functions should only be there if the according option
      is enabled (e.g. method cache) 
    - options only relating to py.py should not appear in
      translated version (unless they work :) 

release naming: 
    1.0 or 0.999 or so - could possibly be decided shortly before the release 

open-ish questions?: 

- JIT integration in March release 
- maybe telling PO that we go for JIT integration in april?
