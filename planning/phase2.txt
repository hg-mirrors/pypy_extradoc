Rough preparation draft for saturday-afternoon meeting Paris  
------------------------------------------------------------- 

sprints & conferences 
-------------------------

- 8th December Calibre/agile development workshop in
  Bruxelles, Bea, Holger, Alastair attending (or maybe
  just two persons).  Bea coordinates. 

- December sprint: a sprint around bruxelles might make sense, 
  holger is checking with bruxelles and Louvain-la-neuve 
  (near bruxelles) people for a sprint beginning of 
  december.  Bea is checking with Mallorca/Barcelona 
  regarding the same time frame.  Nothing definitive 
  yet, alas!  Do we have a double-fallback?  
  Meeting in Sweden? 

- more sprint planning: 

  end january next sprint (mallorca/barcelona), 
  february around PyCon (27th-XXX) (Dallas, Texas) 
  beginning march romania or switzerland (bern?, swiss italian or leysin?) 
  end of april Japan (Bea is investigating dates & location) 
  June, EuroPython (CERN, switzerland, michael/holger?) 
  August, Ireland (through Bea contacts) 
  October, ... 

- conference planning: 

  HALF-FIXED: CCC 27th-30th December Berlin (pypy technical talk accepted, 
  non-technical talk pending, may be unlikely, holger is keeping 
  contact) 

  FIXED: Solution Linux 2006 (31st Januray-2nd Feb): 
  Logilab will present PyPy in the "free software models" track. 

  OPEN: PyCon, 24th-26th Feburary: Holger wants to submit one or two proposals 
  and go there, also doing a py lib and/or pypy-sprint.  Note that 
  sprints are scheduled after the conf. 
  DEADLINE: 30th October (in two weeks!) 

  OPEN: OOPSLA? DEADLINE? 

  OPEN: XP-conferences? DEADLINES? 

pypy technical task planning 
----------------------------------

see paris-2005-possible-tasks.txt 
- full compiler/parser integration  

- pypy-sync meetings should constantly track/amend/modify those 
  technical tasks and in general focus on technical issues 
  NOTE though: pypy-sync cannot focus too much on EU requirements 
  because it's a more open/community forum. 

EU-related Workpackage planning planning phase 2 
------------------------------------------------- 

- WP09 and WP10 done and coordinated by logilab/dfki 
  people.  they should update the rest of us regarding 
  planning and also communicate regarding 
  possible related sprint topics. 

- WP02 dev infrastructure is in merlinux responsibility, 
  should also suggest sprint topics (considering e.g. 
  a py lib sprint at PyCon ...) 

- other WPs in phase 2 are probably more generally in 
  common responsibility (like WP04/WP05) with the lead 
  partner taking special responsibility (towards the EU): 

  - WP03 (HHU) synchronisation CPython 
  - WP06 (HHU) core optimisations 
  - WP07 (tismerysoft) translator optimisations 
  - WP08 (Strakt) dynamic optimisations 
  - WP14 (Changemaker) dissemination/project representation 

  open: 

  - WP05: left over work for Impara (when they get accepted)?
