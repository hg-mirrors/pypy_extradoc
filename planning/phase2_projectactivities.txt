pypy technical task planning 
----------------------------------

Identify tasks to be done in between sprints, start with 
see paris-2005-possible-tasks.txt:
 
- full compiler/parser integration  

- pypy-sync meetings should constantly track/amend/modify those 
  technical tasks and in general focus on technical issues 
  NOTE though: pypy-sync cannot focus too much on EU requirements 
  because it's a more open/community forum. 

EU-related Workpackage planning planning phase 2 
------------------------------------------------- 

- WP09 and WP10 done and coordinated by logilab/dfki 
  people.  they should update the rest of us regarding 
  planning and also communicate regarding 
  possible related sprint topics. 

- WP02 dev infrastructure is merlinux responsibility, 
  should also suggest sprint topics (considering e.g. 
  a py lib sprint at PyCon ...) 

- other WPs in phase 2 are probably more generally in 
  common responsibility (like WP04/WP05) with the lead 
  partner taking special responsibility (towards the EU): 

  - WP03 (HHU) synchronisation CPython 
  - WP06 (HHU) core optimisations 
  - WP07 (tismerysoft) translator optimisations 
  - WP08 (Strakt) dynamic optimisations 
  - WP14 (Changemaker) dissemination/project representation 

  open: 

  - WP05: left over work for Impara (when they get accepted)?
