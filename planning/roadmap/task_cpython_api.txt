Providing the CPython C-API
===========================
Separate compilation would be interesting ground work for a try to compile
cpython modules with a pypy-supplied Python.h file and link them to pypy. This
would require writing a lot of new functions (for the CPython API), though.
Also it is not clear how large the expected speed impact would be (because of 
e.g. pinning).
