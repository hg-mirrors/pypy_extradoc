Hand optimizations
==================

status:

 - Improvements to the interpreter is an ongoing task. Some microbenchmarks
   show particularly bad performance in specific areas.

todo: 

 - There are still some hand optimizations of the Python interpreter
   that are well worth doing, since they can be expected to yield
   significant performance improvements.

expected outcome:

- The amount of effort required to get what kind of speed-up for
  what kind of application remains unknown at this point in time.

dependencies:

- None
