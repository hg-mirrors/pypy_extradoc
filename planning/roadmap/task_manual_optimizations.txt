Hand optimizations
==================

There are still some hand optimizations of the Python interpreter that
are well worth doing, since they can be expected to yield significant
performance improvements. For instance, some of our mircobenchmarks
show particularly poor performance in some areas. The use of better
algorithms should improve our performance numbers significantly for
some of the benchmarks.
