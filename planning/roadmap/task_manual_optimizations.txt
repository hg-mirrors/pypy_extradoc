Hand optimizations
==================

There are still some hand optimizations of the Python interpreter that
are well worth doing, since they can be expected to yield significant
performance improvements. For instance, some of our mircobenchmarks
show particularly poor performance in some areas.

The amount of effort required to get what kind of speed-up for
what kind of application remains unknown at this point in time.
