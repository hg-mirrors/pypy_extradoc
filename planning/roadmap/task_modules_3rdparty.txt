Third party module support
==========================

There are some third party modules that would bring early adopters to
PyPy. They would also serve as code coverage cases. Our time estimate
is a guess on how much time we would need to spend to get enough
traction in the community. Exactly what modules to support needs to
be determined after some of the infrastructure in other tasks is
in place.
