Port more modules to rffi style
===============================

Some standard modules written in C have already been ported to the

XXX Flesh out with some more details. Examples for example.


Move modules from app to interpreter level
==========================================

Some modules are implemented in Python at application level. For
preformance reasons, they should be implemented at interpreter level.

XXX Which ones?

before PyPy is a reasonable replacement for CPython. Exactly which
ones needs some investigation.
XXX Flesh out with some more details. Examples for example.

XXX these tasks should be merged, I think
