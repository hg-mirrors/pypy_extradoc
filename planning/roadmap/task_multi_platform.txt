Multi-platform support
======================

In order to be a viable alternative to CPython, PyPy needs to be
tested and run cleanly on more platforms than it currently does
(Linux/IA32, OS/X, and Windows).  Amd64 with Linux is probably
the most urgent one, but there are probably others that have
some problems.

It probably makes sense to put this item off until we are closer to
having a production ready system for the i386. We also have a possible
volunteer effort under way. It remains to be seen if it takes off.
