Parser cleanup
==============

The parser is in a rather sorry state. Making it support various
versions of Python is currently a rather nasty job. It needs replacing
with a more robust design. The estimates for this are probably too low,
since they were based on the idea of improving the existing parser.
Subsequent attempts to improve the parser have prompted the idea of
a rewrite. In the parser work, there is also time needed to upgrade
the interpreter to handle all of Python 2.5.
