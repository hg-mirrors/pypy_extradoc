Refactor the JIT
================

The JIT is the result of programming under severe time pressure. This
means that the existing JIT framework needs a fair bit of cleanup and
restructuring. Armin also has some ideas for a refactoring based on an
interpreter, rather than annotated graphs. 
XXX maybe phrase this a bit more clearly.
