Implementing missing standard modules
=====================================

Status: 

 - A lot of standard modules such as ``socket`` don't work on top of
   pypy-jvm and pypy-cli

Todo:

 - Implement relevant modules using the API offered by the hosting
   virtual machine (either at app-level or interp-level). E.g.,
   implement ``socket`` on top of JVM/.NET sockets.

 - Maybe it would be possible to reuse existing modules from Jython_
   and FePy_.

Expected outcome:

 - Having a better coverage of the Python standard library

Dependencies:

 - `Separate compilation`_

 - `Refactor RPython external objects interface`_

 - `Integration with the hosting virtual machine`_
