Support a tool like Swig or Boost
=================================

To make it simpler to integrate C extensions with PyPy, we should support
at least one tool that is already in use in the Python community.

Google uses Swig heavily, so in a scenario where Google pays for some
development, it would be natural to do Swig. Once PyPy gets traction
we expect proponents of other tools to make their own ports.
