Support a tool like Swig or Boost
=================================

To make it simpler to integrate C extensions with PyPy, we should support
at least one tool that is already in use in the Python community.

Google uses Swig heavily, so in a scenario where Google pays for some
development, it would be natural to do Swig. Once PyPy gets traction
we expect proponents of other tools to make their own ports.

In addition to Swig, a PyPy version of ctypes should be implemented.
An attempt to build a layer on top of the existing ctypes
implementation for CPython has failed. Ctypes was not written with
this kind of reuse in mind, and it would be harder to change it
than to make an RPython implementation from scratch.

XXX Some example use case needed here.
