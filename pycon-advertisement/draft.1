Support PyPy
============

While we are happy to help you getting your code to work with PyPy,
you may want something more than a bit of guidance over IRC. Some
members of the PyPy development team are available for consulting
work. Here are some examples of what they could do for you:

- Commercial support contracts
- On site mentoring of developers
- Make your codebase compatible with PyPy
- Port your favourite C/C++ extension library to PyPy
- Build tools that are compatible with SWIG/Boost/Cython/whatever
- Make Stackless Python work with the JIT
- Write a backend for your favourite CPU architecture (X86, amd64 and ARM are 
already there)
- Make code that works under PyPy go even faster
- Write an interpreter for your second favourite dynamic programming language
- Implement Python 3.x features
- Build a code obfuscator that is not trivial to work around

Send an email to pypy@openend.se and we will get in touch with you.
