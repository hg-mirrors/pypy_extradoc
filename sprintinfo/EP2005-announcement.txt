Post-EuroPython 2005 PyPy Sprint Announcement 
============================================== 

Time: 1st-7th July 2005 (both days including) 
Location: Goetheborg, Sweden (more details to follow) 


Draft topic announcement 

The main, though not the only, focus of the sprint will be on the
"translation" aspect of PyPy.  We will progress towards a completely
translated PyPy.  How much will already have been done before EuroPython
is unknown; as a guess, we will be left with:
 
- completing the "rtyper", the piece of code that assigns low-level
  C-like types to high-level RPython objects (lists, dicts, instances,
  etc.) and low-level control flow graphs to high-level ones;
   
- polish off the GenC and GenLLVM back-ends, responsible for turning
  the low-level C-like flow graphs into real C or LLVM source code.
 
Non-translation-related topics are welcome too.  Here are some suggestions
from the issue tracker:
   
- integrate the parser module, possibly making it RPython
  conformant;
 
- rewrite in Python a C module you are familiar with
  (partial list of missing/incomplete modules: os, math, array,
  regular expressions, binascii...)

- implement Python 2.3's import hook extensions (zip-imports etc.)

- fix Windows-related issues, '%'-formatting rounding errors,
  add missing docstrings on app-level built-in types and functions,
  etc.

- weakrefs (but this requires discussion and planning on pypy-dev
  before the sprint! feel free to start such a discussion, though.)
