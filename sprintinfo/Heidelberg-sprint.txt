PyPy Sprint in Heidelberg 22nd - 29th August 2005 
==================================================

The next PyPy sprint will take place at the Heidelberg University
in Germany from 22nd August to 29th August (both days included). 
Its main focus is translation of the whole PyPy interpreter 
to a low level language and reaching 2.4.1 Python compliancy.

Goals and topics of the sprint 
------------------------------

XXX The focus will probably be translation issues,
possibly including garbage collection and threading (?).

Location & Accomodation  
------------------------ 

The sprint will be held in a conference room of the Institute of Physics,
University of Heidelberg. We have WLAN connection there and small kitchen
to make tea and coffee. `See here`_ how to get there from the Heidelberg
main station.

There is a huge number of hotels_ in Heidelberg, all of which are
unfortunately rather expensive. It should be no problem to reach the sprint
venue from anywhere in Heidelberg. As an alternative you could also take a
`hotel in Mannheim`_ which you can reach in 15 min from Heidelberg with the
train. If there is enough interest Carl could try to rent a room in a living
group (WG).

Exact times 
-----------

The Pypy sprint is held Monday 22nd August - Monday 29th August 2005.
Hours will be from 09:00 until people have had enough. It's a good 
idea to arrive a day before the sprint starts.   


Network, Food
------------- 

The Heidelberg Altstadt can be reached in approximately 10 min from the sprint
venue. There you will find all kinds of restaurants and fast food places.

You need a wireless network card to access the network.
