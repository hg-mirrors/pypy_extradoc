planning for the time between the Hildesheim and Heidelberg sprints
===================================================================

clean-up areas
--------------

the following issues are meant to be 0.7 issues.

- translate_pypy and the translator class need some cleanup

- initialization of the object space is still messy

- rtyper problem: exceptions are no longer always at the end of a code
  block because of the lowlevel rewriting

- move bits around in the annotator to make different uses
  more pluggable

- better support of math and float exceptions

- reorganizing some wrongly named things

- erasing useless files

- cleanup of import dependencies

- support for tests from external users and different platforms

- preparing the next release

- documentation about external function calls and implementing
  builtin modules

- related to the previous: documenting how interplevel marshal
  is plugged into the system

- prefixing all the C macros and names with pypy

- look into XXX issues

- support producing a windows binary, choose a suitable compiler

additional wild ideas
---------------------

- thinking of an RPython flowgraph interpreter as an executable?
