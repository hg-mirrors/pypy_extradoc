PyPy Sprint in Heidelberg 10th - 16th October 2005 
==================================================

The next PyPy sprint will take place in Paris at Logilab's office
in France from the 10th to the 16th of October 2005 (both days included).

Goals and topics of the sprint 
------------------------------

Now that version 0.7 has been released, it is time for refactoring and planning
of the next features.

For these reasons the main topics of this sprint will be on
 - threading and GC
 - refactoring and translation features
 - discussing about the upcoming JIT, optimizations and stackless features 


Location & Accomodation  
------------------------ 

The sprint will be held in Logilab's offices in Paris. The exact address is::

  10 rue Louis Vicat
  75015 Paris

We'll provide WLAN connection and there is a small kitchen to make tea and coffee.
`See here`_ for a map of the area nearby.

There are two metro lines and three bus lines that stop close to Logilab's:
 - Metro line 12 : stop "Porte de Versailles"
 - Metro line 13 : stop "Malakoff plateau de Vanves"
 - Bus 89 or 58 : stop "Carrefour Albert Legris"
 - Bus PC1 : stop "Porte de la Plaine"

Those are more or less within 5 minutes walk.

There is a huge number of hotels_ in Paris, all of which are
unfortunately rather expensive. Here is another site for `hotels en France`_.

It should be no problem to reach the sprint venue from anywhere in Paris using public transportation.
However it would be better to find accomodation in the southern districts (14th, 15th)
or in the nearby towns (Malakoff, Vanves) not far from Paris. Another good choice is
to find an hotel near one of the metro line above. (avoid long bus trips as it takes
a long time.)
Looking at the map here: hotels_, the area you should look at is between (3) and (6),
(5) is still ok.


As an alternative you could also try to group (4 or 5 people) and try to rent
a furnished appartment for the week. Almost all announces from French websites come
from `Lodgis agency`_. They are rather expensive but most of the time it can be cheaper
than hotels. For the more adventurous you can look on the french site pap_. (select
appartements, département=75, arrondissements=15,14,6)

For transportation we strongly recommend the public transportation (metro and buses).
There are weekly tickets (monday to sunday) from 15.70 euros (Zone 1-2). You need a
picture (ID format) and ask for a *Carte Orange*.
Don't get the tourist's cards which are more expensive and valid only for 5 days.
Also note that zone 1-2 won't pay for your ticket from the airport and is valid only (mostly)
inside Paris.

Exact times 
-----------

The Pypy sprint is held Monday 10th October - Sunday 16th October 2005.
Hours will be from 09:00 until 20:00 or later. It's a good 
idea to arrive a day before the sprint starts.

Network, Food
------------- 

There are plenty of restaurants and sandwich places around and a big supermarket for those
who would rather make their own food.

You will probably need a wireless network card to access the network but we can provide
ethernet cables for those who don't have one.
