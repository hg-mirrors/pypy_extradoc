Tasks
=====

 - javascript interpreter (leonardo, stephan, maciek around)
   addition of numbers, strings (with proper, twisted semantics) works
   integration of the narcissus parser
   nested scopes, variable declarations, functions without parameters
   function arguments working, windows support, in-progress: argument attribute

 - jvm backend
   sharing code between gencli and genjvm
   first tests running!
   number manipulations, field access
   more tests running! added support for classes, in-progress: constants

 - transparent proxies (maciek, guido, samuele around)
   lists are working somehow, refactoring in progress
   dictionaries seem to work somewhat
   provide a way to implement an object that is of type list, but the behaviour
   is defined at app-level

 - apigen tool
   changes to instance variables after calls to functions

 - build tool
   it's now actually building pypy, sending the usession directory back

 - .net integration, fixing pypy.net
   quick hack, but pypy.net is no longer broken

 - making streams RPython (anto, carl friedrich)
   in progress

 - jit code generation
   lots of documentation about the jit-backend interface, fighting with
   ppc code generation
   some refactorings
   looking at whether it's possible to use the llvm code generation
   hackish way: produce strings in memory and have llvm parse them

 - jit ppc code generation (mwh, niko)

 - jit front end (armin, arre, richard)
   IN-PROGRESS
   fixed the last known bug, experimentation needed
   porting portal tests to run with the backends
 
 - running tests on the translated pypy-cs (related to py.test refactoring?)

 - pypy interpreter object optimizations
   
   - lists of integers

 - adding the microbenchmark results to the benchmark page
   DONE

 - trying the jit efforts on a regex engine (richard, armin around)
   kind of worked, some progress

- fixing pypy on windows, adding some more os functions (christian)

- general wizardry (samuele)
