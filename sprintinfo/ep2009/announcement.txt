==================================================================
Birmingham (UK) EuroPython PyPy Sprints 28-29 June/ 3-4 July 2009
==================================================================

The PyPy team is sprinting at EuroPython again. This year there are
`sprint days`_ before (28-29 June) and after (3-4 July) the
conference. Some PyPy core people should be present during both periods.

.. _`sprint days`: http://wiki.europython.eu/Sprints

If you plan to attend the sprints after the conference we recommend
you to listen to the PyPy technical talk (`EuroPython schedule`_)
during the conference since it will give you a good overview of the
status of development.

XXX When/if tutorial?
On the morning of the first sprint day we will also have a
tutorial session for those new to PyPy development.
