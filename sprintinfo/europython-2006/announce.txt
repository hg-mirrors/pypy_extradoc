EuroPython PyPy sprint 6-9 July 2006
====================================================

This sprint will be held right after the EuroPython conference in
Geneva at CERN, from the 6th to the 9th of July 2006.

The main focus of the sprint is yet to be defined.

If you'd like to come, please subscribe to the `pypy-sprint mailing list`_
and drop a note about your interests and post any questions.  More 
organisational information will be send to that list.  We'll keep
a list of `people`_ which we'll update (which you can do so yourself
if you have codespeak commit rights).
