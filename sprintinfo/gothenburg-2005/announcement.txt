Goals and topics of the sprint 
------------------------------

We have released pypy-0.8.0_, which is officially a "research base" for
future work.  The goal of the Gothenburg sprint is to start exploring
new directions and continue in the directions started at the Paris
sprint.

The currently scheduled main topics are:

 - The L3 interpreter, a small fast interpreter for "assembler-level"
   flow graphs.  This is heading towards JIT work.

 - Stackless: write an app-level interface, which might be either
   Tasklets, as in "Stackless CPython", or the more limited Greenlets.

 - Porting C modules from CPython.  (_socket is not finished)

 - Optimization/debugging work in general.  In particular our thread
   support is far from stable at the moment and unaccountably slow.

 - Experimentation: logic programming in Python.  A first step might be
   to try to add logic variables to PyPy.
