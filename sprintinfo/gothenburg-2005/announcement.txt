Gothenburg PyPy Sprint II: 7st - 11th December 2005 
======================================================

The next PyPy sprint is scheduled to be in December 2005 in Gothenborg, Sweden.
Its main focus is heading towards phase 2, which means JIT work, alternate
threading models and logic programming.  (but there are also other possible
topics).  We'll give newcomer-friendly introductions.  To learn more about the
new PyPy Python-in-Python implementation look here:

Goals and topics of the sprint 
------------------------------

We have released pypy-0.8.0_, which is officially a "research base" for
future work.  The goal of the Gothenburg sprint is to start exploring
new directions and continue in the directions started at the Paris
sprint.

The currently scheduled main topics are:

 - The L3 interpreter, a small fast interpreter for "assembler-level"
   flow graphs.  This is heading towards JIT work.

 - Stackless: write an app-level interface, which might be either
   Tasklets, as in "Stackless CPython", or the more limited Greenlets.

 - Porting C modules from CPython.  (_socket is not finished)

 - Optimization/debugging work in general.  In particular our thread
   support is far from stable at the moment and unaccountably slow.

 - Experimentation: logic programming in Python.  A first step might be
   to try to add logic variables to PyPy.

Location & Accomodation  
------------------------ 

The sprint will be held in the apartment of Laura Creighton and Jacob Halen
which is in Götabergsgatan 22. 

Nearest, and probably cheapest is to book accomodation at `SGS Veckobostäder`_.

Exact times 
-----------

The public Pypy sprint is held Wednesday 11th - Sunday 15 December 2005.  Hours
will be from 10:00 until people have had enough. It would be better if you
arrived a day before the sprint starts (there is a sprint for people involved
with the EU part of the project on the two days before the "official" sprint)


Network, Food, currency 
------------------------ 

Sweden is not part of the Euro zone. One SEK (krona in singular, kronor
in plural) is roughly 1/10th of a Euro (9.15 SEK to 1 Euro).

There are some pizzerias, kebab places and the like close to the venue.
Their food is edible and cheap, but not very good. For good food, you need to
go downtown (XXX that was the description for Chalmers, is that still valid?).

You need a wireless network card to access the network. However, we can likely provide 
a wireless/ethernet bridge (XXX).  

Sweden uses the same kind of plugs as Germany. 230V AC.

Registration etc.pp.
