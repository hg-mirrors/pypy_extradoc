Topics
------

Unsorted possible topics for the sprint:

* L3 interpreter, heading towards JIT work

* Stackless, with an app-level interface (Stackless or
  Greenlet?)

* Threading: the main missing piece is thread-local storage in
  RPython

* Optimizations / Phase 2 work in general

* Finish _socket and/or port other C modules from CPython
