PyPy GÃ¶teborg Cleanup Sprint November 19 - November 25 2007
===========================================================

XXX

Topics and goals
----------------

Meta-Tasks
++++++++++

 - Tracker-gardening
 - Start slowly thinking about 1.1 plans

Translation toolchain
+++++++++++++++++++++


 - finish rctypes removal
 - implement correct implicit GIL release

 - move away from implicit keepalives
 - raw_malloc should be split, rffi one should not use obmalloc (it's
   not thread-safe)
 - kill simulator, run the semi space tests on llinterp (may happen
   before)
 - have a moving gc correct version of the gc framework transformation
 - delegate finding type stuff like vtables etc to GC, cleaner interface
   for rtti, simplify translator/c/gc.py
 - think about approaches to id, especially concerning boehm, where the
   id will keep the object alive and concerning a moving GC

 - clean up the tangle of including headers in the C backend

 - review pdbplus, especially the graph commands, also in the light of
   https://codespeak.net/issue/pypy-dev/issue303 and the fact that we
   can have more than one translator/annotator around (with the
   timeshifter)

 - Kill half concrete wrapper
 
 - Kill opaque hacks on the C backend
  
 - decide how to implement constants in rffi
   
 - think about/remove orphaned parts
    
 - finish ll2ctypes, especially rffi_platform

Interpreter
+++++++++++

 - there's a shadow tracking bug it seems

 - fix taint space

 - review the things implemented at applevel whether they are
   performance-critical

JIT
+++

 - start writing real unit tests for the merging logic

and drop a note about your interests and post any questions.  More 
organisational information will be send to that list.  We'll keep a list
of `people`_ which we'll update (which you can do so yourself if you
have codespeak commit rights).  If you have no clue where to stay in
Bern ask around on the list, maybe we can help you find something or
find some other solution.
