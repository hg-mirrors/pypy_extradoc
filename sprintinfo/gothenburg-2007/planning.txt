Topics and goals
----------------

Meta-Tasks
++++++++++

 - Tracker-gardening
 - Review the cpython regression test suite (skips/failures)
 - Start slowly thinking about 1.1 plans

Translation toolchain
+++++++++++++++++++++

 - finish rctypes removal

 - move away from implicit keepalives

 - raw_malloc should be split, rffi one should not use obmalloc (it's
   not thread-safe)

 - delegate finding type stuff like vtables etc to GC, cleaner interface
   for rtti, simplify translator/c/gc.py

 - clean up the tangle of including headers in the C backend

 - review pdbplus, especially the graph commands, also in the light of
   https://codespeak.net/issue/pypy-dev/issue303 and the fact that we
   can have more than one translator/annotator around (with the
   timeshifter)

 - kill half concrete wrapper
 
 - kill opaque hacks on the C backend
  
 - decide how to implement constants in rffi
   
 - think about/remove orphaned parts

 - implement callback mechanism for rffi/lltype/ll2ctypes

 - find out why our memcpy behaves so erratically

 - refactor OO external objects

Interpreter
+++++++++++

 - there's a shadow tracking bug it seems

 - fix the taint space

 - review the things implemented at applevel whether they are
   performance-critical

 - remove prebuilt costate vars  (might happen before)

JIT
+++

 - repair the JIT tests (if it doesn't happen before), the keep alive killing merge broke them

 - start writing real unit tests for the merging logic

Discussion issues
+++++++++++++++++

 - app-level ctypes
 
 - separate compilation
