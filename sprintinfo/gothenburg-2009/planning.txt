    - Anto

discussions to be had:
    - what goals/benchmarks do we want for the prototype
    - things we know are missing
    - state of the tests

    - what to do with ootype
    - how will Eurostars work, how will work be organized


Goals/Benchmarks
-----------------

Goal: be somehow faster than CPython in real programs

Benchmarks:
    - Richards
    - Pystone
    - mako, gadfly, templess
    - port some of the JS benchmarks?
    - look at unladden-swallow benchmarks
    - Sympy
    - Simpy?
    - Pyrolog
    
later:
    - translate.py

- there should be a unified way to run these benchmark
- benchmarks should be run nightly
- we might need a benchmarking server


State of Tests
---------------

- coverage holes in metainterp/optimizer
- coverage of x86 backend needs many random runs – check this!
- need more direct tests of the x86 backend
- some funniness in test_ll2ctypes.py
- run random tests for x86 nightly
- we need tests for pypy-jit behaviour that explicitely check whether the loops
  make sense

things we know are missing
---------------------------

metainterp/frontend:
- virtualizables are not finished
- there is no restriction on the length of the trace
- proper inlining logic
- loop nesting (across calls)
- we need to do something about constantness
- we need to do somethign about assert isinstance(x, Class)
- more backendopt before jitting, assert removal
- many ooisnull guards in a row

- speed of tracing and fallbacks?

backend:
- recompilation after every bridge is bad
- jump backward in x86 backend is inefficient
- memory management for the code
- speed of backend?

Python interpreter:
- lookups of various kinds
- calls‽


TASKS for the morning
