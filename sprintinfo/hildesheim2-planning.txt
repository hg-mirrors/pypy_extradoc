Misc
-------- 

* -> TRACKER write a tool that discovers which revision of the pypy tree 
  broke the high level annotator (in that it produced SomeObjects). 
  Consider distributing the actual annotation to multiple hosts. (holger)

* -> TRACKER: (mostly done) add missing docstrings on app-level built-in types and 
  functions, etc. (Laura): there now is a program that generates the 
  docstrings into the appropriate places but it needs prettification. 
  (christian)

Current Main task: RTYPER issues
-----------------------------------

- do we want to continue to work with the snapshsot? does it make sense
  during the sprint?
  decision: during the sprint use directly the trunk, mail pypy-dev 
  about this (holger, samuele)


- we want to work on pypy/translator/goal/ISSUES.txt

pairs::
    Samuele, Carl Friedrich (progressing on External functions) 
    DONE: refactored math and os function out of annotation/builtin and
    rpython/rbuiltin into the extfunctable, implemented some
    math.*, os.* functions. fixed os.stat

    Open issues:
    -  RPython string -> C null-terminated string 
       conversion. The null termination char is not there!
  
    - The flow  space kills exception  handling for built-ins,
      this is not what we want e.g. for os.* functions;
      decide new criteria. Maybe only for thing in __builtin__
      or list only the built-ins we want exception handling 
      suppressed.

    - finish os.path.exists and os.path.isdir support

     (Armin, Carl Friedrich)


    Armin, Christian (random RTyper problems)
    DONE: down to override:cpy_stablecompiler,
    up to wrap/unwrap issues related to faking.
    The hope is that we can get rid of faking.
 
    Completing marshal, made it into a mixed-module
    that can be geinterped. 

    Plan: enable pyc loading to bootstrap compiler
    at app-level (Christian, Richard)

    Richard, Holger (getting rid of faked files) 
    DONE: importing uses only os.* functions at
    interp-level. With --file option sys.std*
    use our own app-level implementation of files.
    --file is on by default now when translating
