Hi folks, 

from 21st (arrival) till 28th (departure) May some of the PyPy 
group are going to meet in Iceland and sprint on the upcoming
0.9 release of PyPy.  This sprint is kindly hosted and sponsored 
by EWT and CCPgames and thus we should be able to arrange 
funding for travels and accomodation.  There are also non-pypy 
activities going on and people such as Tim Peters and other
python-dev core developers plan to attend.  If you'd like to 
help and join PyPy hacking around some vulcanos (actually
we are meeting in Reykjavik, but well :), please mail Armin 
or Holger until end this week (friday 21st).  

We intend to give a PyPy tutorial but will otherwise focus on
release goals, so we may select participants by their 
interest and ability to help there.  The release targets
a variety of features (extension module compiler + extension coding, 
stackless transformations, documentation & testing, many other 
little topics like work on the CLI backend?) so don't feel 
easily discouraged :)
