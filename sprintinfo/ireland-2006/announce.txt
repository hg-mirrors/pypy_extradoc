====================================================

The next PyPy sprint will happen in the nice city of 
Limmerick in Ireland from 21st till 27th August.  

The main focus of the sprint will be on JIT compiler works, 
various optimization works, porting extension modules, 
infrastructure works like a build tool for PyPy, or 
extended (distributed) testing. 

It's also open to new topics.  If you are a student
consider to participate in Summer of PyPy (XXX insert 
reference) in order get funding for your travels 
and accomodation. 

During the first day (21st of August) there will be introduction
talks and a workshop/seminar with external participants from the 
University and the `Calibre`_ project.  The workshop
will likely cover both technical and methodology aspects. 
You may also just attend that first day. 

If you'd like to come, please subscribe to the `pypy-sprint mailing list`_
and drop a note about your interests and post any questions.  More 
organisational information will be send to that list.  We'll keep
a list of `people`_ which we'll update (which you can do so yourself
if you have codespeak commit rights).
