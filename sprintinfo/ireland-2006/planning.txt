Ireland sprint planning
--------------------------

timings: 
    monday, tuesday, wednesday full days
    thursday half 
    friday 2pm- 
           5pm tutorial  + Q & A session 
    bea arranges a dinner table friday evening 
    
* core optimizations
  (mwh, arre)
  - (done) did a lot of profiling, main finding: GC 
  - (next) optimising GC 
  - experiment with optimising builtin lookups 
    e.g caching method lookups or callback-dict 

* ext compiler
  maybe a topic for the weekend 

* JIT
  (armin, samuele)
  - (done) first machine code generation tests are passing 
    (next) more of the same 
  - produce machine code in-memory from running the generated CFGs 
  - maybe think about refining the interface to generating
    I386 machine code (also considering a PPC asm backend) 

  
* distributed testing
  (maciej, hpk)
  more or less done, but many things : 
      - use "/usr/bin/rsync" to sync to remote 
      - master does collection of items 
      - "leaf" items are asynchronously send to "Executors" (running on nodes)
      - super-simple reporting 

  
  (arigo) wrote a generic interface that works via greenlets or threads interchangeable
