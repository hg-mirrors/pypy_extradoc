    bea arranges a dinner table friday evening 
    
* source optimizations
  (mwh, arre)
  - builtin lookups 
  - caching method lookups 
  - profiling

* ext compiler
  maybe a topic for the weekend 

* JIT
  - so far generating a jit for simple interpreters kind of
    works
  (armin, samuele)
  - produce machine code in-memory from running the generated CFGs 
  - maybe think about refining the interface to generating
    I386 machine code (also considering a PPC asm backend) 

  
* distributed testing
  (maciej, hpk)
  - use "/usr/bin/rsync" to sync to remote 
  - master does collection of items 
  - "leaf" items are asynchronously send to "Executors" (running on nodes)
  - super-simple reporting
