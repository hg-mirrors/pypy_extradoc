Tasks
=====

JIT
---

* "virtual frames" (Samuele, Arre): funfunfun. basic test is working,
  manually written virtualizable structs can be change within the jit-generated
  code and the changes are seen from outside. 
  started a new test, refactoring necessary. IN-PROGRESS

  - write a small interpreter that shows the performance problems without having
    to use the full pypy

  - actually implement support for this in the rtyper and the jit...

* have register allocation: IN-PROGRESS: redesigned the
  backend interface a bit, adapted all the backends to the changes. Michael
  started completing the PPC backend, but is getting annoyed
  Armin started working on register allocation on i386



py.test and the py-lib
----------------------

* polish the code and documentation of the py lib, and eventually
  release it MORE PROGRESS

* integrate api-doc and source-viewer on the py-lib web-page IN-PROGRESS
  (Guido, Holger)

* use source-viewer on more code? pypy? IN-PROGRESS

* debian packaging for the py-lib: HUGE PROGRESS (Alexandre, Sylvain)

* (provide code search facility)

* detailed (and growing) TODO list in py/documentation/TODO.txt


interpreter prototypes
----------------------

* discuss the status of the various prototypes (coordinated by arre?)

* think especially hard about persistence

* discuss fallback possibilities if py.execnet cannot run on pypy-c

* (maybe try the taint object space on a cgi example + write some docs?)


Integration and Configuration
-----------------------------

* actually use the build tool during the sprint (Michael, Carl Friedrich): DONE
  WITH BUGS

* think about py-lib and pypy debian packaging

* document in some detail the configuration

* integrate wp9, wp10 work?

* web frontend on the build tool

Other
-----

* progress on the JavaScript interpreter (Leonardo, Maciek): IN-PROGRESS,
  the JS intepreter translates. There is now an interactive interpreter.

* Java backend (Niko, Antonio): lot of random problems fixed, test_class runs
  completely. test_pbc is next!

* investigate why the annotator fails when doing --faassen with gencli?!
  (Anto, general wizards around)

* discuss refinement interface for external functions

* (make py-lib run on pypy-c) PROGRESS: the compiler problems are fixed

* "shadow tracking" (Carl Friedrich, Samuele), DONE

* progress on the LLVM JIT code generator (Eric, Armin)
