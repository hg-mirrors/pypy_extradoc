Tasks
=====

JIT
---

* "virtual frames" (Samuele, Arre): funfunfun. basic test is working,
  manually written virtualizable structs can be change within the jit-generated
  code and the changes are seen from outside. IN-PROGRESS

  - write a small interpreter that shows the performance problems without having
    to use the full pypy

  - actually implement support for this in the rtyper and the jit...

* have register allocation (Michael, half Armin): IN-PROGRESS: redesigned the
  backend interface a bit, adapted the llgraph and i386 backends to the
  changes. now: fixing llvm and ppc backends


py.test and the py-lib
----------------------

* polish the code and documentation of the py lib, and eventually
  release it IN-PROGRESS (Holger, Maciek)

* integrate api-doc and source-viewer on the py-lib web-page IN-PROGRESS
  (Guido, Maciek around)

* use source-viewer on more code? pypy? IN-PROGRESS

* debian packaging for the py-lib: HUGE PROGRESS (Alexandre, Sylvain)

* (provide code search facility)


interpreter prototypes
----------------------

* discuss the status of the various prototypes (coordinated by arre?)

* think especially hard about persistence

* discuss fallback possibilities if py.execnet cannot run on pypy-c

* (maybe try the taint object space on a cgi example + write some docs?)


Integration and Configuration
-----------------------------

* actually use the build tool during the sprint (Guido, Carl Friedrich): DONE
  WITH BUGS

* think about py-lib and pypy debian packaging

* document in some detail the configuration

* integrate wp9, wp10 work?

* web frontend on the build tool

Other
-----

* progress on the JavaScript interpreter (Leonardo, half Armin): IN-PROGRESS,
  the JS intepreter translates

* Java backend

* discuss refinement interface for external functions

* (make py-lib run on pypy-c) PROGRESS: the compiler problems are fixed

=============================

* eu meeting: thursday 5pm
  - status and plans for wp6 and wp12
  - wp9 + wp10 + wp11 discussion
  - eu-report meeting
