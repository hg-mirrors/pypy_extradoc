Tasks
=====



JIT
---

* "virtual frames"

  - write a small interpreter that shows the performance problems without having
    to use the full pypy

  - actually implement support for this in the rtyper and the jit...

* have register allocation

(Michael, Armin, Arre, Samuele)


py.test and the py-lib
----------------------

* polish the code and documentation of the py lib, and eventually
  release it (Holger and Maciek to investigate)

* integrate api-doc and source-viewer on the py-lib web-page

* use source-viewer on more code? pypy?

* provide code search facility



interpreter prototypes
----------------------

* discuss the status of the various prototypes (coordinated by arre?)

* think especially hard about persistence

* discuss fallback possibilities if py.execnet cannot run on pypy-c

* (maybe try the taint object space on a cgi example + write some docs?)


Integration and Configuration
-----------------------------

* actually use the build tool during the sprint (Guido, Carl Friedrich)

* think about py-lib and pypy debian packaging

* document in some detail the configuration

* integrate wp9, wp10 work?

* web frontend on the build tool

Other
-----

* progress on the JavaScript interpreter (Leonardo, Antonio)

* Java backend

* discuss refinement interface for external functions

* (make py-lib run on pypy-c)


Discussions during the sprint
=============================

* status of wp6 and wp12

* wp9 + wp10 + wp11 discussion

* eu-report meeting

* pycon talk discussion

* release plannings
