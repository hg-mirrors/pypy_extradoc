XXX nice introduction

------------------------------
Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

* Like previous winter, the main side goal is to have fun in winter
  sports :-) We can take a couple of days off for ski; at this time of
  year, ski days end before 4pm, which still leaves plenty of time
  to recover (er, I mean hack).

* the overall idea of the sprint is to continue working on making PyPy ready
  for general use.

Location & Accomodation
-----------------------

Leysin, Switzerland, "same place as before".  Let me refresh your
memory: both the sprint venue and the lodging will be in a very spacious
pair of chalets built specifically for bed & breakfast:
http://www.ermina.ch/.  The place has a baseline ADSL Internet connexion
(600Kb) with wireless installed.  You can of course arrange your own
lodging anywhere (so long as you are in Leysin, you cannot be more than a
15 minute walk away from the sprint venue), but I definitely recommend
lodging there too -- you won't find a better view anywhere else (though you
probably won't get much worse ones easily, either :-)

I made pre-reservations in the Chalet, so please *confirm* quickly that
you are coming so that we can adjust the reservations as appropriate.
The rate so far has been 60 CHF a night all included in 2-person rooms,
with breakfast.  There are larger rooms too (less expensive, possibly
more available too) and the possibility to get a single room if you
really want to.

Please register by svn:

or on the pypy-sprint mailing list if you do not yet have check-in rights:

You need a Swiss-to-(insert country here) power adapter.  There will be
some Swiss-to-EU adapters around - bring a EU-format power strip if you
have one.

XXX is this correct?
Officially, 12th-19th January 2008.  Both dates are flexible, you can
arrive or leave earlier or later.  We will give introductions and
tutorials on the 13th, in the morning if everybody is there, or in the
afternoon otherwise.
