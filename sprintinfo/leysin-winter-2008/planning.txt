Task ideas
==========

 - try getting debug information in the Java class files (Carl Friedrich,
   Paul) DONE

 - benchmark the size of the young nursery for generational GC (Olivier,
   most of Armin) IN-PROGRESS, the result is that picking half the L2 cache
   size for the nursery sounds good

 - look at the RPython microbenchmarks for Java (Toby, Armin around)
   DONE, fixed sized-lists are slow
 
 - work on CTypes (Maciek, Armin) general non-progress

 - think about summarizing test outcomes

 - JVM integration (probably only when Anto is here)

 - look at the CLI integration on the clr-module-improvements/ branch and
   maybe improve/merge it? SOME PROGRESS, we gave up because python.net wasn't
   working correctly (Anto, Paul)
   
 - implement fixed-size lists as arrays in the ootypesystem (Carl Friedrich,
   Toby) IN PROGRESS, backend support missing
