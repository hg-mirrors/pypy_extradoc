Leysin Sprint Planning
======================

release tasks:
 - fix stackless pickling with optimizations (Carl Friedrich, Samuele)
 - nice to have: stackless recursion limit on the rpython level (Armin, Niko)
 - fix stackless in conjunction with C callbacks
 - stackless and threads?!

 - decide what to do with:
    - llvm backend
    - js backend
    - lang
 - state of the windows build (get back to bigdog)
 - last lib-python failures (Iko, Christian)
 - do we want to implement setting thread's stack size?
   see http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.4/lib/module-thread.html function
   stack_size (Iko, Christian)

 - documentation tasks:
    - entry points for users of our Python Interpreter (for install and use)
    - provide docs on differences to Cpython and the state of support for
      extension modules and ctypes
    - go through examples to see whether  they still work
    - review old docs

non-release tasks:
 - JVM backend:
    - performance sucks
    - no way to interface with anything

meetings:
 - Thursday 17.00 IRC meeting
 - JIT presentation (Armin, Carl Friedrich)
