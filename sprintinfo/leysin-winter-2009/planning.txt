Leysin Sprint Planning
======================

release tasks:
 - fix stackless pickling with optimization NEARLY DONE, waiting for a
   translation, needs to be merged (Carl Friedrich, Samuele around)
 - nice to have: stackless recursion limit on the rpython level IN-PROGRESS,
   some bugs left
 - fix stackless in conjunction with C callbacks PARTIALLY DONE: they don't
   explode any more (Carl Friedrich, Armin when he appears)
 - stackless and threads?!

 - decide what to do with:
    - llvm backend
    - js backend
    - lang
 - state of the windows build (get back to bigdog)
 - last lib-python failures IN-PROGRESS: two failures left
 - fix tracing hook problems: (Christian, ...)
 - do we want to implement setting thread's stack size?
   see http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.4/lib/module-thread.html function
   stack_size (TESTING)

 - documentation tasks:
    - entry points for users of our Python Interpreter (for install and use)
    - provide docs on differences to Cpython and the state of support for
      extension modules and ctypes
    - go through examples to see whether  they still work
    - review old docs

non-release tasks:
 - JVM backend:
    - translation broken (Niko, Anto)
    - performance sucks
    - no way to interface with anything

meetings:
 - Thursday 17.00 IRC meeting
 - JIT presentation (Armin, Carl Friedrich)
