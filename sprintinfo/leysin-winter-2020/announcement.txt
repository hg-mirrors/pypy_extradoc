=====================================================================
Leysin Winter sprint 2020: Feb 28 - March 7th
=====================================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in Leysin, Switzerland, for the fourteenth time.
This is a fully public sprint: newcomers and topics other than those proposed
below are welcome.


Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

The list of topics is open.  For reference, we would like to work at least
partially on the following topics:

* HPy
* Python 3.7 support

As usual, the main side goal is to have fun in winter sports :-) We can take a
day off (for ski or anything else).


Times and accomodation
----------------------

The sprint will occur for one week starting on Friday, the 28th of February, to
Friday or Saturday, the 6th or 7th of March 2020.  It will occur in Les
Airelles, a different bed-and-breakfast place from the traditional one in
Leysin.  It is a nice old house at the top of the village.

We have a 4- or 5-people room as well as up to three double-rooms.  Please
register early!  These rooms are not booked for the sprint in advance, and
might be already taken if you end up announcing yourself late.  (But it is of
course always possible to book at a different place in Leysin.)

You can register by adding your name in people.txt here.  For more information,
write to me directly at armin.rigo@gmail.com.
