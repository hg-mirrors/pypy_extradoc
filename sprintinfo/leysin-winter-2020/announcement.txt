=====================================================================
Leysin Winter sprint 2020: Feb 29 - March 8th
=====================================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be in Leysin, Switzerland, for the fourteenth time.
This is a fully public sprint: newcomers and topics other than those proposed
below are welcome.


Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

The list of topics is open.  For reference, we would like to work at least
partially on the following topics:

* HPy
* Python 3.7 support

As usual, the main side goal is to have fun in winter sports :-) We can take a
day off (for ski or anything else).


Times and accomodation
----------------------

The sprint will occur for one week starting on Saturday, the 29th of
February, to Sunday, the 8th of March 2020.  It will occur in Les
Airelles, a different bed-and-breakfast place from the traditional one in
Leysin.  It is a nice old house at the top of the village.

We have a booked room for up to 7 people (plus extra smaller rooms possible).
(Of course it is always possible to book at a different place in Leysin.)
