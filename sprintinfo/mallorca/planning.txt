Tasks
======

  - integration of the garbage collection toolkit with the
    offsetof work done: Carl Friedrich, Richard

  - improving the way we interface with external functions.
    (also think about how exceptions fit in there)

later:
======

  - our threading implementation is still incredibly
    slow, we need to work on that.

  - refactor argument handling and calls in the object space

  - look into how the LLVM JIT works

  - transformations to be more clever with checking for
    exceptions

  - socket module
    already improved but still far from complete
