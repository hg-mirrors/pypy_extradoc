Tasks
======

  - JIT: Armin, Carl. Graph generating ops

  - stackless application level interface: Christian, Eric
    Design thinking. Coding could start today.

  - l3interp/offsetof/sizeof work: Michael, Arre
    Progress. Next sizeof...

  (- integration of the garbage collection toolkit with the
    offsetof work done: Carl Friedrich, Richard
    Offsetof refactoring finished. Continuing with sizeof ...)

  - improving the way we interface with external functions.
    (also think about how exceptions fit in there):
    add static ctypes functionality into RPython itself
    Gerald, Stephan, Samuele

later:
======

  - our threading implementation is still incredibly
    slow, we need to work on that.

  - refactor argument handling and calls in the object space

  - look into how the LLVM JIT works

  - transformations to be more clever with checking for
    exceptions

  - socket module
    already improved but still far from complete
