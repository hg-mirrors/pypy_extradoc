Tasks
======

  - JIT:  Arre, Samuele
   Graph generating ops
   Designed interface (see draft-jit-ideas),
   started refactoring llabstractinterp to use the operations
   (issues: llabsinterp was inspecting the graphs a lot )

  - stackless application level interface: Christian, 
    started from the demo coroutine impl, trying to expose
    at application level, both greenlet and stackless-like interfaces.
    (issues: testing needs translation, the primitives are not
     there on top of CPython, maybe use stackless or greenlet
     to provide them or make the bytecode itself on top of CPython
     stackless). Next step: fastest possible translation for testing.

  ( - l3interp/offsetof/sizeof work:
    Progress. Progress needs either hacks and assuming Boehm
    or GC integration. Try to progress assuming Boehm )

  - integration of the garbage collection toolkit with the
    offsetof, sizeof work done: Carl Friedrich, Michael (Richard)
    
  - improving the way we interface with external functions.
    (also think about how exceptions fit in there):
    add static ctypes functionality into RPython itself
    Gerald, Stephan, Armin
    glued atoi from ctypes (cheating a bit)

    Next: rtyper implementation of ctypes-like structures,
          probably use Address as much as possible
    
     


later:
======

  - our threading implementation is still incredibly
    slow, we need to work on that.

  - refactor argument handling and calls in the object space

  - look into how the LLVM JIT works

  - transformations to be more clever with checking for
    exceptions

  - socket module
    already improved but still far from complete
