Computer Science department of Heinrich-Heine Universität 
Düsseldorf (Germany).

------------------------------
Goals and topics of the sprint
------------------------------

There are many possible and interesting sprint topics - 
here are some goals and ideas: 

* work towards PyPy 1.1 release
* make pypy-c fit for small devices like mobile phones
* try out Python programs and fix them or fix PyPy or fix performance bottlenecks
* other interesting stuff that you would like to work on ...;-)

------------------------------
Getting there
------------------------------


The sprint will take place in a seminar room of the computer science
department. It is in the building 25.12 of the university campus, second
floor. For travel instructions see

Accomodation
------------------------------

We may be able to fit some people into private flats 
and otherwise there are several hotels, one recommended 
one is the http://www.hotel-hillesheim.de/ where we are
investigating regarding a group rate - if you are interested
please register and tell ASAP. 

There are also some hotels that are used by visitors to the university and are
quite close to the uni. None of us have been at them, so we have no experience
of how good they are.

1. Hotel Blättler

2. Hotel Mooren

3. Hotel Europa
can't seem to find a website

4. Schloss Mickeln
This one is the guest house of the university in a very beautiful castle.
Supposed to be extremely nice, but also expensive.
