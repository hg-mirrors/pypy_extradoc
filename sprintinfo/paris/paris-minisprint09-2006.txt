Sprint report Paris mini sprint September 25th to 29th
========================================================


Participants: Aurelian Campeas and Anders Lehmann

The main goal of the sprint was to enable translation of the Logic objspace with constraint variables, constraint propagation and distribution, using clonable computationspaces the Oz style.

After several attempts, in the well known style of translate add "assert isinstance(..." translate again ...., we reached at a point were we tripped a bug in the inlining code.

After that bug was fixed we believe that the goal was reached and the Logic objectspace now translates!

We were not able to actually test if it works though, during the sprint.

As a job to do while we were waiting for the translation to fail, a small test object space were made to experiment with clonable threads. This is not committed as the Logic objecspace contains the functionality.

We also took a stab at "recomputation" (an optimisation technique from Oz). The code was not quite finished at the end of the sprint and is thus uncommitted.
