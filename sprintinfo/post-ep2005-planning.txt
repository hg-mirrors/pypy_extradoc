    - introduction to PyPy 
        high level architecture (Armin or Holger?)

    - introduction to Annotation + RTyping?  (Samuele or Armin)
        working on examples

Translation tasks 
------------------

* currently remaining rtyper topics: 

  - found to be missing (ale, arigo)::

            Builtins
            --------

            (strange)(delegating to backend?) sys.getrefcount
            (medium) applevel sys module should not refer to 
                     interplevel sys.getdefaultencoding
            (generate c_api calls) os.path.exists 
            (generate c_api calls) os.path.isdir 

            Unary operations
            ----------------

            rclass: (easy) issubtype

            Overridden functions in PyPy
            ----------------------------

            (easy) override:ignore
            (easy) override:instantiate
            (hard, probably needs to be implemented at C/CPython level): 
                override:wrap_exception_cls
                override:fake_object
                override:cpy_compile

* (partially DONE) convert each file that does 
  'from ... import *' to use explicit imports (e.g. 
  from pypy.rpython import lltype and then use lltype.*) 

* fix floats::
    - translator/c/float_include.h should catch floating-point signals
      with a technique similar to CPython's.
    - objspace/std/floatobject.py needs some clean-ups:
      look for XXX, for %reimplement% and for all try:except: blocks.


Move to Python 2.4.1
----------------------- 

subcoach: Armin
Niklaus, Gintas, Ignas, Arre, Anders, Mikael 


experiment in a branch with using Python 2.4 semantics 
and the standard library 

* use lib-python/2.4.1 instead of 2.3.4, review all modified 
  tests and library modules

* semantic differences: comparison of recursive data structures,
  more?

* new required C-level modules: 'sets', 'collections'

* run tests (including compatibility lib-python tests) 

Misc
-------- 

* (medium) write a tool that discovers which revision of the pypy tree 
  broke the high level annotator (in that it produced SomeObjects). 
  Consider distributing the actual annotation to multiple hosts. 

* (medium) finish objspace/std/longobject.py.

* (hard) find a way to generate c_api calls with automated 
  conversions from ll-strings to c-like strings 

* fix Windows-related issues

* '%'-formatting rounding errors  (  '%.3f' % (2.999999,))

* add missing docstrings on app-level built-in types and functions,
  etc.

* GC discussion in the middle of the sprint  (kickoff Carl Friedrich) 
  3rd 

Rewriting important C functionality in Python 
--------------------------------------------------

* parsing/compiling  (Adrien, Gustavo)

    * translate to C (fix annotation problems by either
      tweaking the code or extending the annotator on 
      a case-by-case basis) 
    * move towards a rpython compliant (translatable) compiler 

* _sre module reimplementation kickoff 

* rewrite in Python a C module you are familiar with
  (partial list of missing/incomplete modules: os, math, array,
  regular expressions, binascii...)

* implement Python 2.3's import hook extensions (zip-imports etc.)

* (hard) weakrefs (but this requires discussion and planning on pypy-dev
  before the sprint! feel free to start such a discussion, though.)


LLVM Backend
-------------------

- implement variable sized structs (Richard, Eric / Carl)

- support function pointers 

- implement exceptions (Carl, Ludovic)  

- try to integrate Boehm GC
