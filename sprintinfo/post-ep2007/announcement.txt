Vilnius/Post EuroPython PyPy Sprint 12-14th of July
========================================================

The PyPy team is sprinting at EuroPython again and we invite
you to participate in our 3 day long sprint at the conference hotel
- Reval Hotel Lietuva.

If you plan to attend the sprint we recommend you to listen to the PyPy
technical talks (`ep schedule`_) during the
conference since it will give you a good overview of the status of development.

.. _`ep schedule`: http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=13919&showDate=all&showSession=all&detailLevel=contribution&viewMode=room

On the morning if the first sprint day (12th) we will also have a
tutorial session for those new to PyPy development.

There are many possible and interesting sprint topics to work on - here
we list some possible task areas:

* completing the missing python 2.5 features and support
* identify slow areas of PyPy through benchmarking and work on improvements,
  possibly moving  app-level parts of the Python interpreter to interp-level
  if useful.
* there are some parts of PyPy in need of refactoring, we may spend some time
  on those, for example:

    - rctypes and the extension compiler need some rethinking
    - support for LLVM 2.0 for th llvm backend
    - ...

* some JIT improvement work
* port the stackless transform to ootypesystem
* other interesting stuff that you would like to work on ...;-)
