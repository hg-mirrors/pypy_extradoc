Open areas in translation 
------------------------------------- 

Still missing are:

* currently remaining rtyper topics: 

  - (hard) (holger, armin) prebuilt constants -- PBCs -- and dicts with PBC keys
    DONE 1. call to memoized functions, at first with a single PBC arg 
    DONE 2. removed the only usage of specialize:memo with more than one PBC key

  - (probably trivial) verify that we've done all the builtins we
    need for translation.     

  - (hard) a few more operations: issubtype, ...?
      found to be missing (ale, arigo):

            Builtins
            --------

            (discuss) apply
            (remove) callable
            (should be hidden by the specialcase)compile
            (remove) hasattr
            (is not there)long
            (easy) slice
            (easy) tuple
            (easy) unicode
            (removed) zip
            (easy) xrange
            (easy) max

            (easy) math_floor
            (easy) math_fmod
            (easy) ovfcheck
            (easy) ovfcheck_lshift

            (strange)(delegating to backend?) sys.getrefcount
            (medium) sys.getdefaultencoding

            (easy) time.time

            (delegating to backend) os.path.dirname
            (delegating to backend) os.path.normpath
            (delegating to backend) os.path.join
            (delegating to backend) os.path.exists
            (delegating to backend)os.path.isdir

            (should not be there) __import__


            Unary operations
            ----------------

            rclass: issubtype

            rdict: method_get
                   method_copy
                   method_update
                   method_keys
                   method_values
                   method_items

            fix the code not to use str.split()

            rpbc: is_true


            Binary operations
            -----------------

            cmp ?
            rint: divmod
            coerce ??

            rstr: mul, inplace_mul


            Overridden functions in PyPy
            ----------------------------

            override:ignore
            override:instantiate
            override:wrap_exception_cls
            override:fake_object
            override:cpy_compile


* DONE (ale, arre) lltype will also need to grow a new primitive type, UnicodeChar.

* (partially DONE) convert each file that does 
  'from ... import *' to use explicit imports (e.g. 
  from pypy.rpython import lltype and then use lltype.*) 

* (samuele, michael) GenC knows little about float operations.  Need to complete
  translator/c/float_include.h.

* progress on translation of example targets:
    python demo/bpnn.py (samuele, michael) 
    python pypy/translator/goal/translate_pypy.py targetrichards.py

* (medium) write a tool that discovers which revision of the pypy tree 
  broke the high level annotator (in that it produced SomeObjects). 
  Consider distributing the actual annotation to multiple hosts. 

* (medium) experiment in a branch with using Python 2.4 semantics 
  and the standard library (lib-python/2.4.1 ...)

* (medium) finish objspace/std/longobject.py.

* (hard) try out if genpickle.py can be used to save and load 
  the high level annotated flowgraphs of PyPy
