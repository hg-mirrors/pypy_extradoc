Open areas in translation 
------------------------------------- 

Still missing are:

* currently remaining rtyper topics: 

  - found to be missing (ale, arigo)::

            Builtins
            --------

            (strange)(delegating to backend?) sys.getrefcount
            (medium) applevel sys module should not refer to 
                     interplevel sys.getdefaultencoding

            implement in RPython (and change importing.py accordingly) 
            os.path.dirname/normpath/join (including the closure of what they use) 

            (generate c_api calls) os.path.exists 
            (generate c_api calls) os.path.isdir 

            Unary operations
            ----------------

            rclass: (easy) issubtype

            (arre, christian): 
            rdict: (DONE) (easy) method_get (?)
                   (DONE) (easy) method_copy
                   (DONE) (easy) method_update (?)
                   (DONE) (easy) method_keys (?)
                   (DONE) (easy) method_values (?)
                   (DONE) (easy) method_items (?)
                   (DONE) (easy) contains		  
            (easy) rstr: str.split(single_constant_character)

            (easy) rpbc: is_true  -->  False for None
                                       True for all other PBCs


            Binary operations
            -----------------

            (easy) rstr: mul, inplace_mul  (for CharRepr only!)

            (easy) 'contains' applied on:
                     * dict of string keys
                     * constant tuple of ints
                     * constant tuple of strings
                     * constant tuple of unicode characters
                     * constant dict with int keys (which are pending now)
                     * constant string
                     * string
                     * list of instances
                     * list of strings
                     * list of unicode characters

            Overridden functions in PyPy
            ----------------------------

            (easy) override:ignore
            (easy) override:instantiate
            (hard, probably needs to be implemented at C/CPython level): 
                override:wrap_exception_cls
                override:fake_object
                override:cpy_compile

* prebuilt immutable dictionaries with int keys

* (partially DONE) convert each file that does 
  'from ... import *' to use explicit imports (e.g. 
  from pypy.rpython import lltype and then use lltype.*) 

* DONE (holger, michael) translator/c/float_include.h should be complete. 

* progress on translation of example targets:
    python demo/bpnn.py   (holger, michael, samuele) 
    python pypy/translator/goal/translate_pypy.py targetrichards.py

* (medium) write a tool that discovers which revision of the pypy tree 
  broke the high level annotator (in that it produced SomeObjects). 
  Consider distributing the actual annotation to multiple hosts. 

* (medium) experiment in a branch with using Python 2.4 semantics 
  and the standard library (lib-python/2.4.1 ...)

* (medium) finish objspace/std/longobject.py.

* (hard) find a way to generate c_api calls with automated 
  conversions from ll-strings to c-like strings
