Open areas in translation 
------------------------------------- 

Still missing are:

* Almost all the topics from the rtyper, from the previous
  status report:

  - (hard) (holger, armin) prebuilt constants -- PBCs -- and dicts with PBC keys
    DONE 1. call to memoized functions, at first with a single PBC arg 
    2. find out if we really have visible dicts with PBC keys

  - (probably trivial) verify that we've done all the builtins we
    need for translation.     

  - (hard) a few more operations: issubtype, ...?
        task: go through all space operations listed in baseobjspace.py
              annotator/{unary.py,binary.py} 
              one by one and decide if they should be supported
  
* lltype will also need to grow a new primitive type, UnicodeChar.

* (partially DONE) convert each file that does 
  'from ... import *' to use explicit imports (e.g. 
  from pypy.rpython import lltype and then use lltype.*) 

* (samuele, michael) GenC knows little about float operations.  Need to complete
  translator/c/float_include.h.

* progress on translation of example targets:
    python demo/bpnn.py (samuele, michael) 
    python pypy/translator/goal/translate_pypy.py targetrichards.py

* (medium) write a tool that discovers which revision of the pypy tree 
  broke the high level annotator (in that it produced SomeObjects). 
  Consider distributing the actual annotation to multiple hosts. 

* (medium) experiment in a branch with using Python 2.4 semantics 
  and the standard library (lib-python/2.4.1 ...)

* (medium) finish objspace/std/longobject.py.

* (hard) try out if genpickle.py can be used to save and load 
  the high level annotated flowgraphs of PyPy
