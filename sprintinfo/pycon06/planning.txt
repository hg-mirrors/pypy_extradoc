Goals and topics of the sprint 
------------------------------

While attendees of the sprint are of course welcome to work on what
they wish, we offer these ideas:

  - Work on an 'rctypes' module aiming at letting us use a ctypes
    implementation of an extension module from the compiled pypy-c.
    Bob, Michael T, jiwon, gene, mwh + arigo, samuele around a bit

  - Writing ctypes implementations of modules to be used by the above
    tool. 
    pmaupin, ...

  - Implementing Python 2.5 features in PyPy
    martin, arre, stewart, ...

  - Implementation of constraints solvers and integration of dataflow
    variables to PyPy.
    george, anders l

  - Implement new features and improve the 'py' lib and py.test 
    which are heavily used by PyPy (doctests/test selection/...).
    jan, brian, 

  - JIT stuff
    joshua, + arigo, samuele

  - LLVM backend work
    pmaupin, rxe

  - ootypesystem improvements/smalltalk/lisp backend
    nik, even more samuele, mwh?

  - Generally experiment with PyPy -- for example, play with
    transparent distribution of objects or coroutines and stackless
    features at application level.

  - Have fun!
