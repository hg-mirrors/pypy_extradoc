Post-PyCon 2006 Sprint Report
=============================

After PyCon this year, we held four days of sprints.  There were lots
of people new to PyPy and a couple of old friends we hadn't seen for a
while.

Day 1
-----

Monday began with a 45 minute introduction/tutorial by Michael (which
was videoed -- watch for it arriving on codespeak soon-ish) and then a
planning session, where we divided up into pairs or threes and decided
what we'd be working on for the rest of the day.

This plan went out the window fairly quickly though, for a variety of
reasons...

Day 2
-----

The Tuesday began with a status meeting where we talked about what
we'd acheived the day before and basically decided that most of us
would carry on with the same things (this proved to be a much more
accurate plan than the previous day's...).

Day 3
-----

By Wednesday, the sprint was thinning out...

Day 4
-----

XXX Did enough work get done on Thursday to even bother mentioning it?
