Post-PyCon 2006 Sprint Report
=============================

After PyCon this year, we held four days of sprints.  There were lots
of people new to PyPy and a couple of old friends we hadn't seen for a
while.

Day 1
-----

Monday began with a 45 minute introduction/tutorial by Michael (which
was videoed -- watch for it arriving on codespeak soon-ish) and then a
planning session, where we divided up into pairs or threes and decided
what we'd be working on for the rest of the day.

This plan went out the window fairly quickly though, for a variety of
reasons... (?)

Armin and three PyPy newcomers -- Mick, Gene and Joshua -- dived into
the ever popular rctypes. They made annotation work for all ctypes
types and cleaned up bits and pieces. Along the way, they also started
implementing a new registry mechanism for external functions, aiming
at getting rid of the approximately 42 steps required to add a new
external function.

The two Canadian newcomers -- Stuart and Martin -- got introduced to
PyPy by Arre, implementing the new 2.5 builtins any() and all().
They proceeded with implementing the new with keyword (PEP 308),
which despite some parser/compiler hairyness apparently went quite
smoothly.

Anders L. and George took a tour the logic programming facilities in
PyPy and worked on a Sudoku solver using the computation space. But
they were slowed down quite a bit by bugs. The code was not checked
in until after the sprint.

Richard and Pat -- who was hooked on PyPy at the last PyCon sprint --
hacked the LLVM backend back into shape (it was broken due to ongoing
work in the GC area). Various compatibility issues with LLVM versions
were also tackled. 

Samuele and Nik picked up the lately neglected ootypesystem and
ported PBC tests over from lltypesystem, fixing various loose ends
like __init__ and keyword arguments support.

Let's not forget the py.lib sub-sprint happening in the same room as
the PyPy sprint, starring Holger, Jan and Brian. Unfortunately the
Texas Mystery Disease was making the rounds in the py.lib team, both
Holger and Brian weren't feeling well, so there was only little
progress generally improving win32 support of the py.lib.

Day 2
-----

The Tuesday began with a status meeting where we talked about what
we'd acheived the day before and basically decided that most of us
would carry on with the same things (this proved to be a much more
accurate plan than the previous day's...).

Day 3
-----

By Wednesday, the sprint was thinning out...

Day 4
-----

The sprinters who had lasted this long were mostly in shutdown mode
already, with many of them flying out in the afternoon. There wasn't
any formal planning meeting. Some code was written anyway. Armin
worked on SpaceOperation.cleanup; Gene and Armin on rctypes
specialization; Samuele and Nik on __del__ support for ootypesystem;
Arre, Anders L. and Stuart on making parser/compiler translatable
again; and Richard on running LLVM tests with the isolate tool.

Most people left during the afternoon. The remaining handful hung
out at the hotel pool and were later joined by people from other
sprints for a beer and pizza happening. The PyCon organizers even
pointed a wireless router from one of their hotel rooms at the pool,
for those who couldn't stop sprinting even at 9 pm, lying in a deck
chair, typing single-handedly since one hand was clasping a beer ...

We'll be back next year!
