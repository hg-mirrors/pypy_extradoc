Tokyo Sprint Planning
---------------------

Sprint Times: 10 am to 7 pm

Break day: Wednesday


Sunday, 23. April 2006
**********************

Present: Samuele, Arre, Valentino, Eric, Yutaka, Sanghyeon, Yusei, Bea, Nik, George

General Interests:

  - gensqueak/ootypesystem (Nik)

  - Implementing Python 2.5 features in PyPy. (Yusei)

  - Progress further on an 'rctypes' module aiming at letting us use a ctypes
    implementation of an extension module from the compiled pypy-c.

    - check status
    - ctypes time and socket (and select ;))

    (Arre, Valentino, Eric)

  - rctypes support for LLVM (Eric)

  - convert JS backend to ootypesystem (Eric, Nik, Yusei)

  - genjs test failure fixes (Eric)

  - raisingops transformation (Eric)

  - PyPy debian packaging (Yutaka, Holger?)

  - Fun with the Common Lisp backend (Yutaka, Valentino)

  - Possibly experiment with writing modules translatable for use both
    in PyPy and CPython. (Sanghyeon, Armin?)
  
Pairings today:

  - ctypes time and socket (and select ;)) (Arre, Valentino, Eric, Sanghyeon)

  - ootypesystem introduction, gensqueak/gencl (Nik, Yutaka, Yusei, George)

  - general wizardry (Samuele)

Present: Samuele, Arre, Valentino, Eric, Sanghyeon, Bea, Nik, Anders, Daiki, and later, Yutaka and Yusei

Status after day 1:

  - gensqueak/ootypesystem (Nik)

    * introduction done
    * steps towards making gencl use current infrastructure

  - Implementing Python 2.5 features in PyPy. (Yusei)

  - Progress further on an 'rctypes' module aiming at letting us use a ctypes
    implementation of an extension module from the compiled pypy-c.

    - check status (DONE)
    - ctypes time and socket (and select ;))

        * added errno functionality
        * refactor to latest ctypes version
        * wrote test for finding missing socket methods+added stubs

    (Arre, Valentino, Eric, Sanghyeon)

Pairings today:

  - ctypes time and socket (and select ;))
    (Arre, Valentino, Eric)

    * Anders will join Arre, Valentino and Eric

  - ootypesystem introduction, gensqueak/gencl
    (Nik, Yusei, Sanghyeon)

    * more steps towards making gencl use current infrastructure
      (Nik, Yusei, Sanghyeon)
    * during sprint some ootype issues will be resolved by
      Samuele and Nik (tuples list...)

  - general wizardry (Samuele)

    * bit running around and working with Nik in the afternoon
      on ootype


Tuesday, 25th April 2006
************************

Present: Samuele, Arre, Valentino, Eric, Sanghyeon, Bea, Nik, Anders, Daiki

Status after day 2:

  - Orientation on pickling support for cells and generators for being able 
    to pickle tasklets (Eric)

  - gencl (Sanghyeon, Nik, Yusei)
     * instance creation and function call
     * code reorganization and cleanup (and Valentino)

  - Progress further on an 'rctypes' module aiming at letting us use a ctypes
    implementation of an extension module from the compiled pypy-c.

    - ctypes time and socket (and select ;))

        * sockets now listen for connections and connect correctly
        * they also actually send and receive data
        * lower level ctypes wrapper almost complete

    (Arre, Valentino, Eric, Anders)

Pairings today:

  - Work on pickling support for cells and generators for being able 
    to pickle tasklets (Eric)

  - reorganize the new socket module in the right project location (Arre, Anders)

  - compile pystone in gencl (Valentino, Sanghyeon)

  - Conceptual design decisions about ootypesystem (tuples list...) (Samuele, Nik)

Thursday, 27th April 2006
************************

Present: Samuele, Arre, Valentino, Eric, Sanghyeon, Nik, Anders

Status after day 3:

  - gencl (Sanghyeon, Valentino)
    * refactored another bit
    * superclasses and inheritance and isinstance and range
    * Record type

  - Pickle support for cell objects (Eric)
    * works but breaks translation

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik, Samuele)
    * Improved forward references and made the List type lazily inittable.
    * Introduced the Record type
    * Introduced Range support in the OOTypeSystem.

  - ctypes _socket (and select ;))  (Arre, Anders)
    * Passing 14 tests for the translatable module
    * It should be translatable now (although not tested)

Pairings today:

  - Pickling cells (Eric)
    * fix translation
    * add support for additional objects like code objects.

  - ctypes _socket (Arre, Anders)
    * Pass all previous tests.
    * start proper translation work.

  - OOTypeSystem (Nik, Sanghyeon)
    * Dictionaries need to be lazy too.
    * Record type for iterator and tuples and make it generic
    * String type

  - progress further on rpystone gencl translation (Valentino)

  - general wizardry (Samuele)
