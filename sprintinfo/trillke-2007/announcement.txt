Some two years and thousands of commits later, the EU project
period of the PyPy project is about to close ...  and a new
period to begin: we are going for a sprint of three days of
focusing on EU reports and administrative issues, and three
days of happy hacking on the numerous interesting open ends of
PyPy, the source code.  

We also intend to discuss and state our view on the time after
the EU period (March 2007 is the last EU funded month),
because clearly the project will not stop after our successful
(knock knock!) completion of the EU project.  It's already
clear that some of us seriously plan for a relaxation time, 
i.e. one without having many obligations.  But that should
not keep us from thinking and envisioning the development 
from April on.  

So to the Sprint: we have two parts of the sprint, first the EU 
and second the public all-invited part:: 

    26th Feb - 28th Feb     EU reports and admin 
    1st March               break day
    2nd March - 4th March   public coding "beyond EU" sprint 

All days are meant as full days, please arrive 25th Feb / 1st March 
and leave 5th March to help our pairing and logistical planning. 

---------------------------------------------
Possible Topics for the coding sprint 
---------------------------------------------

* working on .NET, Java and other backends 

* working on the Javascript, Prolog or a new frontend

* Tuning the JIT, refining approaches

* Fixing PyPy-1.0 problems / improving it (PyPy-1.0 is
  scheduled for Mid February, btw)

* improving the py lib/py.test, build environments, preparing 
  for server administration efforts from April on 

* Work on/with prototypes that use the new features that PyPy enables:
  distribution `[2]`_ (based on transparent proxying `[3]`_),
  security `[4]`_, persistence `[5]`_, etc. `[6]`_.

* discussion about the time after March, and how to
  organize/co-ordinate ourselves 

* all topics that are of interest otherwise (including
  maybe working on some particular EU related topics still!)

Location & Accomodation
