People coming to the PyPy Trillke 2007 sprint 
==================================================

People who have a ``?`` in their arrive/depart or accomodation
column are known to be coming but there are no details 
available yet from them.

Use ``Accomodation = Ermina`` for the group booking at the Chalets.
Recommended arrival day is the 7th (there might not be enough rooms
available if everybody shows up on the 6th!)
