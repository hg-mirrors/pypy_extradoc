Agile Business and EU funding: sprint methodology in funded OSS project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:
-------------
This paper uses an evolutionary approach, a walkthrough of the history of the 
PyPy project, touching down on different aspects of agility. 

In the founding of the community there was a clear vision of agile development and sprints as the key method. The idea of EU-funding and the process in achieving this created a paradox: how to keep the agile open source community structure with key aspects of the project being funded through EU. 

This then exposed the project to formal requirements planning, estimation,resource tracking and the challenge was to design a process in which a balance was struck between community and consortium, between a developer driven process and formal organinizational structure. 

The evolution of the project - from a non profit Open Source initiative to a partial funded EU project - made possible the growth of Agile Business. 


The vision: the creation of an OSS community
--------------------------------------------

Founding PyPy:

Agile approaches:
- sprints
- testdriven development

Community structure:
- transparent communication
- decision making
- interaction with other communities


The idea: Framework 6 programme IST funding for OSS work
--------------------------------------------------------

"Why do you want money - aren´t you guys non-profit?":
- impact for the EU

"Why do we want money - isn´t OSS non-profit?":
- impact for the community

Proposal and negotiations:
- formal requirements
- organizational limbo

The Project: consortium and companies within a OSS community structure
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Forced entrepreneurship:

Creating the consortium:

Formalizing aspects of the community:
- roles and responsibilities


The challenge: balancing agile OSS community structures with EU requirements
