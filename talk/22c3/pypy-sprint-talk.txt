Title:  agile open-source methods <-> business/EU-funding 

Subtitle: Sprint driven development in Open Source projects - 
          agile methods in open-source related companies 

Section: Hacker(ethik)

Talkers: Holger Krekel, Beatrice Düring

Abstract (max 250 letters): 

    There is a growing number of open-source developers organized 
    and connected to company and business related work.  We 
    report our experiences from the first year of the PyPy project which 
    has a 7 company/university consortium and a 1.3 Million Euro research
    grant from the European Union.  Moreover, we carry together
    experiences from other projects and companies such as 
    Canonical (doing infrastructure for the Ubuntu distribution). 

    We´ll present our own experiences from managing an agile
    and distributed OSS development process in the PyPy
    project, XP-style "sprint driven", during the last year and 
    relate this to the requirements from the European Union. 

    We'd like to discuss models and experiences for connecting 
    open-source culture driven development to business related 
    projects and goals with the audience.  

Description (250-500 words): 

    We are going to briefly describe the organisation of the PyPy project, 
    showing how formal stakeholders and OSS Python community interact 
    through agile practices like sprinting.

    We will also reflect on the aspect of diversity, combining technical 
    and non technical people and skills in the PyPy project and learnings
    from this.

    We will relate the various agile techniques used in PyPy to the 
    agile practices known from the work in the Agile Alliance (XP, Scrum, 
    Crystal Clear) and tell you what we know of how other projects
    are doing it. 

    Lastly we will also share our experience of various challenges and 
    possibilities when integrating the different cultures and skills from 
    the OSS perspective, EU perspective and the Chaos Pilot/process management 
    perspective - managing diversities.
