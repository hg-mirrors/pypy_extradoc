Title: The PyPy fireworks

Subtitle: ???


Section: Hacking 

Talkers: Holger Krekel, Carl Friedrich Bolz, Armin Rigo

Abstract (max 250 letters): 

    This talk describes cool and novel language features of the PyPy project (a
    next generation Python interpreter) which are made possible by its flexible
    architecture. The talk focuses mostly on showcasing interesting and useful
    features together with example usages and less about their implementation.

Description (250-500 words): 

    PyPy is a reimplementation of Python written in Python itself, flexible and
    easy to experiment with. Due to its flexibility it is easy to add language
    features that are sometimes hard to implement in more traditional VM
    implementations. We have implemented a number of such features, some of them
    greatly enhancing the expressivity and flexibility of the language.

    Development of PyPy is partly funded by the European Union 
    during the 6th Research Framework programme.
