PyPy: JIT (and more) for free
=============================

The PyPy project has recently gathered a lot of attention for its progress in
speeding up the Python language -- it is the fastest, most compatible and most
stable 'alternativeÂ´ Python interpreter.  No longer merely a research
curiosity, PyPy is now suitable for production use.  

PyPy is not only a Python implementation, but also a general framework to
implement dynamic languages and get many features for free, like a JIT
compiler and a fast GC.  Examples of other languages implemented in PyPy are
Smalltalk, Prolog and Javascript.

This talk will be divided in two parts, with different target audience:

  * for Python developers: why (and how) to use PyPy instead of CPython?

  * for language implementors: why should you use PyPy to implement your
    revolutionary dynamic language?
