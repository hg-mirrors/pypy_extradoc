Peek under the hood
====================
 
 * PyPy feature: ``sys.pypy_repr`` function

 * allows you to get the interpreter-level representation of an object

 * in the compiled PyPy version you get the name of the RPython class

 * ... demo

Stackless Features (1/2)
========================

 * PyPy can be translated with stackless features

 * allows arbitrarily deep recursion

 * enables usage of coroutines

 * tasklets and channels (as in Stackless Python)

 * greenlets without evil platform hacks


Stackless Features (2/2)
========================

 * experimentally: (un-)pickling of coroutines

 * working on: making coroutines clonable

 * made possible by our mark-n-sweep GC


Lazy Computations
=================

 * two object spaces with lazy features

 * thunk object space: lazy computed objects

 * logic object space: logic variables, unification, microthreads


The Thunk Object Space
======================

 * new builtin: ``thunk``

 * takes a function and arguments

 * returns something that behaves like the result of the call

 * the call is made as late as possible

 * only when the value is actually needed

The Logic Object Space
======================

 * ``newvar``: makes a new unbound logic variable (prolog and Oz-like)

 * ``unify``: unifies two expressions

 * trying to access an unbound var blocks the current thread

 * ``wait_needed(X)`` waits until somebody needs the var ``X``

 * ``uthread(callable, *args)`` starts a new thread


The Extension-Compiler
======================

 * pypy extension modules are written in RPython

 * extensions translated to efficient low level code
 
 * the extension compiler makes these useable with CPython

 * write fast extensions for PyPy `and` CPython

RCTypes
=======

 * Makes it possible to use RCTypes in RPython

 * usual type restrictions apply

 * dynamic libary calls are translated to real ones

 * makes wrapping of libaries easy and testable

 * again useable with PyPy and CPython
