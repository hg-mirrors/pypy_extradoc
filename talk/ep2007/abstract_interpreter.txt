Speakers: Holger Krekel & Maciek Fijalkowski

Abstract
---------

We would like to present features showcasing PyPy's flexible architecture,
in other words, what makes the pypy interpreter unique. Showcases will
include PyPy's approach to distribution, security (ruby-like tainting),
lazy computations and others. Talk will be need-based, showing various
usecases of our flexible interpreter in use.
