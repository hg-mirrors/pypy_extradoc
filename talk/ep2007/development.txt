Post Mortem: development practices and infrastructure
in the EU open source research project PyPy

How did the development process and infrastructure of the PyPy
project change during the period of EU-funding?  We will talk about 
our experiences regarding the evolving development environment (version 
control, automated test-driven development, sprints, synchronization, 
"conceptual integrity", communication channels). We will also share our
"learning by burnings" so that other projects can explore other
creative problems and mistakes than maybe repeating the ones we 
identified during the last 3 years of PyPy development. And hopefully
we will be able to show that the OSS development style is compatible 
with EU-funding.
