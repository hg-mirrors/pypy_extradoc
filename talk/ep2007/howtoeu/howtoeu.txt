How to do an open source EU research project
==================================================


:authors: Lene Wagner, Holger Krekel (merlinux GmbH) 
:event: 10.7.2007, EuroPython 2007, Vilnius 


Intro 
=================== 

- have participated and contributed to the PyPy EU project 
- experiences 
- discuss *open source* research projects 
  (skip IPR issues more or less completely) 

EU Framework Research Programme 
====================================

- IST = Information Society and Technology 
- PyPy was a STREP 
- FP7 spends some 20.000.000.000 Euro in 7 years 
- regularly publishes Work Programmes and Topics 
- puts out CALLS for Proposals 
- we mainly try to discuss FP7 (a few changes from FP6) 

Getting started 
=====================

- vision / idea? 
- reading Work programmes / CALL topics 
- finding people to collaborate 
- finding a set of organisations 
- drafting a proposal ... 

(Research) Objectives? 
==============================

- core research objective(s)
  (state of the art & how the project aims beyond) 
- core technical objectives? 
- core other objectives? (methodological/social) 

can you summarize it on one page? 

The Proposal 
===============

- High level Objectives 
- Impact on industry and society 
- management structures
- work plan in long form
- detailed description of work packages 
- budget

Work Packages 
=================== 

- each has a specific objective 
- Person Months allocated from Partners 
- Lead Partner 
- Deliverables (Reports, Releases, Papers) 

Consortium 
============================

- looking for interested parties 
- consortium consists of organisations 
- is collective entity towards EU 
- requires co-ordinator/contact person for EU 
- receives and distributes money


Applying to the EU 
=========================

- answer to CALLS within stated deadline 
- co-ordinator registers project and proposal 

XXX (lene) co-ordinator or EU-officer?

- proposals gets reviewed by *independent* experts 
- proposals receive points (PyPy had 26 out of 30) 
- Invitation to "negotiation" 
- Project duration?

Negotiation 
==============

- discuss criticism of reviewers, change proposal 
- Prepare paperwork (CPF = Contract Preparation Forms) 
- sign CONTRACT with the European Union 

Funding Schemes
=====================

- Universities receive (basically) 75% funding 
- Small/Medium Companies (SME) receive 75% funding of costs 
- actual or 20% flat administrative overheads accountable


Signing the contract? 
========================
XXX (lene) i do not understand this slide

Infrastructure 
==================
- ensure close collaboration of non co-located developers
- ensure openness for external contributors
- ensure consistency of codebase/project
- PyPy: IRC, svn, mailing lists


Management structures  
============================

- Administrative team (preparing Consortium decisions) 
- Technical Board (discussing problems, deciding roadmap) 
- developer body (everybody can participate) 
- Consortium and Co-ordinator


Meetings and Sprints 
============================

- sprints are the rhythm of the project 
- plan for core and for newcomer-friendly sprints 
- integrate a model for funding contributors! 


Contractual and actual developments 
=====================================
- Contract implies a 'plan' for the development
- Project may evolve into other directions
- checkpoints for assessing the work package status 

Planning for changes 
===========================

- be able to shift work among partners
- if necessary: amend work plan, change the contract with the EU
- but: don't touch the objectives!


Reporting / Deliverables 
============================

- interim reviews each 12-18 months 
- Deliverables: Reports, Releases etc. 
- Deadlines 
- official submission of Reports/Documentation to EU

Recommendations 
====================

- sprint-driven model of development;
- share some funding with upcoming contributors;
- balance contractual with community interests 
- consider changes to the contractual work plan if 
  it fits the objectives better;
- implement a transparent and flat communication and decision
  culture, be ready to adjust roles and not stick to formal issues too much. 
- dual-use Deliverables for for Community/Industry and EU contract purposes


Roles and Responsbilities 
============================

- assign responsibilities to people 

  - per aspect (administration, technical, research) 
  - per work package

- plan for changing responsibilities 

Changes from FP6 to FP7 
=============================
XXX (lene) not sure if this slide is necessary, most 
changes are only interesting for those who 
participated in FP6, and that are not many of the 
audience. keeping the statements vague, as i only looked up 
a summary page: 

http://www.finance-helpdesk.org/front/ShowCategory.aspx?ItemID=883

- apparently FP7 improves some regulations that PyPy found burdonsome
- less collective financial responsibility 
- 75% funding for (small/medium) companies 
- subcontracting relaxed (important for international companies)


What Remains? 
================================

- build the project on a shared vision and shared interest
- don't build it on money (too much)
