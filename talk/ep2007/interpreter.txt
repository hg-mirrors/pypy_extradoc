What features?
--------------

* We don't change python syntax nor semantics

* avoiding religious war...

* they give new dimensions to how you can use pypy

* peak the feature set of your choice...

XXX crap

Multiple object implementations
-------------------------------

XXX rant about python exposing impl details to use? (sets vs dicts)

* same types - different implementations

* example - ropes

* example - multidicts

Transparent proxy
-----------------

* proxy: intercept any operation on an builtin object

* transparent: don't change object interface 

* useful for implementing application level functionality 
  orthogonally to usage of objects 

* is the mechanism for distribution and persistence prototypes

* see also .NET TransparentProxy








* distribution

* stackless

* security (taint space)

* thunk space

* persistance

* JIT (unsure, will be on the previous talk)

* pickling computations?

* disclaimer (not ready for production use, etc)
