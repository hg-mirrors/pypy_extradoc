I'm listing here some ideas gathered around on IRC:

1. "A usual pypy talk" - architecture, motivation etc.
2. An RPython talk: .NET, JVM, JS, extcompiler, possible uses, caveats,
   probably some architecture
3. Interpreters talk: taint, thunk, persistance, distribution, probably
   some stackless (?), interpreter for .NET (hpk, fijal)
4. Some agile talk (?) (Bea)
