RPython: need for speed
=======================

XXX: suggestions for title are welcome :-)

Speakers: Antonio Cuni & Maciek Fijalkowski

Abstract
--------

Restricted Python (RPython) is a subset of Python designed to be
compiled into efficient executables, up to 300 times faster than
CPython.  Although it was born as an implementation detail of PyPy,
experience showed that it can be useful by itself. This talk will
present some typical RPython's use cases, including: how to write an
extension module for CPython, how to produce .NET
libraries/executables as fast as C#, how to write AJAX applications
without a single line of Javascript.
