Why invent new language?
------------------------

* Grown as side effect of the pypy project

* Python is too slow for some purposes

* Pyrex/C are ugly

* We want to play as it were Python as much as possible

What is RPython?
----------------

* Python (every RPython program has the same meaning
  when run on top of CPython)

* Restricted subset

* Constructed from live objects - initialization
  is fully done in Python

* XXX more?

Restricted, what do you mean?
-----------------------------

* Full type inference - you cannot mix incompatible types

* No dynamic stuff: switch class, add/remove methods, etc.

* Java-like object model

* No support for special methods (only __init__ and __del__ works)

* No frames and such stuff

XXX crappy examples expand or delete (probably would be
XXX better to just say few words

* [1, 2, 3, 4] is ok, ['sss', 2] not

* (1, 'xx') is ok, but cannot be mixed with ('xx', 1)

Example of use case
-------------------

XXX write down some simple example for that one

* Write code

* test/debug on top of CPython

* compile

* graph viewer


....

* Few words about type annotation

* Big disclaimer: use at your own risk

* C backend - extension modules

* C backend - standalone programs

* CLI/JVM backend

* creating .NET libraries for C#/IronPython (in the future also for Java/Jython)

* JS backend - few examples, bnb etc, play1

* (optional) common problems with RPython

* ...
