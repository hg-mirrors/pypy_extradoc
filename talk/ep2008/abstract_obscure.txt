PyPy - garbage collection details.

Summary
=======

Obscure, naked, details of garbage collection strategies available in pypy.
Will contain performance difference of various operations depending on
chosen GC.

Abstract
========

In this talk, we'll cover garbage collection strategies present in PyPy.
We'll not go into implementation details of those, but instead we'll
try to explain how certain operations behave and especially how they
present different performance characteristics than cpython's reference
counting strategy. We'll also explain why certain programming patterns
work well on some garbage collectors and doesn't work too well on others
and how to avoid such obstacles.

Proposed Length of talk required
================================

30 minutes.

Brief Biography
===============

Maciej Fijalkowski is a core pypy developer, particularly interested
