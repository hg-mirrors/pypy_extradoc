PyPy status
===========

* more details recent developements

* where we're going

* sponsorship (?)

Production ready
=====================

* We concentrated on running
  existing applications on top of pypy

* Sometimes requiring to change applications slightly

Ctypes
======

* Official way to have bindings to 
  external (C) libraries for pypy

* Slow, but getting better

* Sponsored by google

* Can handle ie pysqlite-ctypes, pyglet, pymunk or Sole Scion

Ctypes configure
================

* Our own small addition to general
  ctypes usefulness

* Invokes C compiler for small details

* Can handle #defines, types, structure layout
  etc.

Sqlite
======

* Part of cpython stdlib

* We use Gerhard Haering's ctypes version
  (XXX link)

* Works reasonably well after fixes

Django
======

* We run (almost) unmodified django

* Only sqlite DB backend for now

* We'll run 1.0 definitely

Pylons
======

* Worked almost out of the box once eggs
  are working (1 day)

* No sqlalchemy yet

Twisted & Nevow
===============

* Twisted have some glitches

* Nevow works

* We don't support pycrypto nor pyopenssl

Bittorrent
==========

Conclusion
==========

* There is no feature obscure enough for people
  not to rely on it

* Generally it's fairly unlikely we'll ever try
  to support stuff without tests

Examples of obscure features
============================

XXX - non-string keys in typedict

XXX - list comprehension variable in __all__

XXX - relying on untested and undocumented private stuff
      (zipimport._zip_directory_cache)

Speed - comparison with CPython
===============================

XXX fill me

Speed - decent gcs
==================

* Faster than refcounting

* Still need some glitches

Speed - JIT
===========

* Not ready yet!

Other backends
==============

* pypy-jvm runs!

* more integration between pypy-cli and .NET

* general speed improvements

* both backends are progressing - very slowly though

XXX anything else?
