We will give an update on the state of PyPy, the Python
implementation in Python.

Part 1
======

PyPy has come a long way.  It's gone from being purely a
research project to providing a flexible and reasonably fast
Python Interpreter, itself implemented in Python.  PyPy is
able to run sophisticated python applications like Django and
Twisted.  We will focus on improvements that happened during
the last year in PyPy.  This talk will also explain the
motivations driving current PyPy developement and its targets
for the future.

Part 2
======

The PyPy Just-in-Time compiler generator is finally ready for
prime time.  It can generate from our Python interpreter a JIT
compiler that is following the lead of JavaScript's
TraceMonkey: it is a tracing compiler (as recently included in
FireFox).  We will give the status of the implementation of
our JIT, with speed measures.

We will then describe how it all works.  In particular, as
usual in PyPy, we can generate such a tracing compiler for any
language for which we have written an interpreter.
