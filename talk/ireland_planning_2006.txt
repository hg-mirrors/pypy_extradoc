Planning Ireland visit (IONA/UCD) 
=====================

Time: 2006-02-06/2006-02-07

Participants PyPy: 
- Beatrice Düring/Change Maker
- Holger Krekel/merlinux


IONA workshop 2006-02-06
=================
- contact: Niall Donnelly, manager of engineering operations (Sean Baker)
- agenda 17th of January, 13:00-17:00
- participants IONA: good cross of management, senior engineers and 
  product management people, so maybe a group of 6-8 people.
-idea: 
		a round table meeting at IONA between IONA/PyPy and
		in which we explore our different perspectives
		in sprinting and agile/distributed work


Information about IONA (agile, distributed, OSS):
------------------------------------------------
- we are a combination of proprietary and open source projects development. 
- have 4 development sites - a large number for a company of relatively small size. 
- Certainly we are very much interested in agile distributed process. 
- OSS too, because we are new-ish to open source development, open source community processes
   would be of big interest to us as well.

- Some of the more formal processes like sprinting (we do 2-week
   iterations, and some pairing, but not in a formal manner and my guess is
   we are not likely to change this too much either for now), test-driven
   (this we do already), and open communnication (do this also), no need to
   go into these in much detail, we are fairly familiar with all this.

- It would be worth a small session on EU funding and requirements (saw
  this on a document you co-wrote from the Web). It is not relevant to us
  now, but that may only be because we know nothing about it, I think an
  introduction to this would be worthwhile, we will certainly learn
  something new.

- work within Eclipse, currently interally but also soon in a OOS environment. 
- Internally, IONA is a C++ and JAVA development house, about 50/50 for proprietary products. 
- OSS, we are so far exclusively Java development (but may in the near future also look at C++ OSS stuff). 
- An example of an OSS project can be found with Celtix,go to http://forge.objectweb.org/projects/celtix/

Methodology and agenda IONA workshop:
----------------------------------------

UCD talk 2006-02-07
==============
- contact: Joe Kiniry, School of Computer Science and Informatics
- agenda: send out 17th of January
- participants: students
- idea:  2 talks at UCD, one technical and one methodology talk (ca 3hrs in total)

Information about UCD:
-----------------------
I teach three courses concurrently in the second term, all of which focus on software engineering with team-based project development.  A lecture
about the PyPy methodology (lightweight, sprint-based development, how you identify and track bugs, assign tasks, communicate, etc.) would be of
interest to many of my students.  We could either organise your giving one talk to many of them at the same time (big event) or a few shorter/smaller
talks during normal lecture times (these are < 1hr).

(Do we fit in to your curriculum?)

In general, yes, as I lecture on the above topics and emphasise that different teams have different practices, having an outside person confirm this
for the students and give a new point of view would be a Good Thing.
