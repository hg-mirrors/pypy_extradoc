Why yet another python interpreter?
===================================

* PyPy - very compatible to CPython

* Interpreter written in a static subset of Python

* Waaaay easier to experiment with

Interpreter startup time
========================

XXX

Memory usage
============

* Pluggable garbage collectors - why not come with something
  embedded friendly?

* Less per-object overhead

* Impossible in CPython optimizations

Multiple interpreters
=====================

* Again, pluggable GCs

* Share some static data (pyc files, modules, etc.)

JIT
===

* In progress for x86

* Why not run on ARM as well?
