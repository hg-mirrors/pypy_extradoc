The PyPy Project And You
========================

Abstract
--------

  PyPy aims to provide a common translation and support framework for
  producing implementations of dynamic languages, emphasising a clean
  separation between language specification and implementation
  aspects and a compliant, flexible and fast implementation of the
  Python Language using the above framework to enable new advanced
  features without having to encode low level details into it.

  This paper gives a brief overview of the motivation and status of
  PyPy and attempts to explain why anyone who cares about the
  implementation of dynamic languages should be interested in it.
