Going from interpreters to VMs
------------------------------

In PyPy interpreters are written in RPython:

* A subset of Python amenable to static analysis

* Still fully garbage collected

* Rich built-in types

RPython is still close to Python.

Going from interpreters to VMs (2)
----------------------------------

The translation tool-chain implements good static compilation
of RPython to multiple targets.

It has pluggable backends, and inserts low-level details
as needed (*translation aspects*).

Translation details
=======================

.. raw:: html

   <table border=0><tr><td>

- First, load and initialize RPython code inside a normal Python VM

- RPython translation starts from the resulting "live" bytecode

- Unified "intermediate code" representation:
  a forest of *Control Flow Graphs*

.. raw:: html

   </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><img src="flowgraph.png"></td></tr></table>

Translation details (2)
=======================

PyPy uses abstract interpretation extensively:

- to construct Flow Graphs
- for type inference
- to gather info for some optimisations
- for Partial Evaluation in the generated Dynamic Compilers...

also uses Flow Graph transformation and rewriting.

Type Systems
=========================

We model the different targets through different type systems:

- LL (low-level C-like targets): data and function pointers, structures,
  arrays...

- OO (object oriented targets): classes and instances
  with inheritance and dispatching

Type systems (2)
===========================

Translation:

* starts from *RPython Flow Graphs*

* turns them into *LL Flow Graphs* or *OO Flow Graphs*

* the flowgraphs are transformed in various ways

* then they are sent to the backends.


Translation aspects
========================

The interpreters in RPython are free of low-level details
(as required to target platforms as different as Posix/C
and the JVM/.NET).

- Advanced features related to execution should not need wide-spread
  changes to the interpreters

- Instead, the interpreters should use support from
  the translation framework

Translation aspects (2)
========================

Examples:

- GC and memory management

- memory layout

- stack inspection and manipulation

- unboxed integers as tagged pointers

Implementation
==================

- Translation aspects are implemented as transformation of low-level
  graphs

- Calls to library/helper code can be inserted too

- The helper code is also written in RPython and analyzed and translated

GC Framework
===============

The LL Type System is extended with allocation and address manipulation
primitives, used to express GC in RPython directly.

- GCs are linked by substituting memory allocation operations with calls
  into them

- Transformation inserts bookkeeping code, e.g. to keep track of roots

- Inline fast paths of allocation and barriers

.. MMTk reference

Stackless transformation
=========================

Inserts support code around calls such that the stack can be unwound.

- Functions can store their current activation frame state to the heap

- Chains of saved activation state can be resumed

We have implemented coroutine switching using this.

A special aspect

**Generating JIT compilers**

.. raw:: html

   </center>

JIT motivation
==================================

Flexibility vs. Performance:

* Interpreters are easy to write and evolve

* For high performance, dynamic compilation is required

Traditional JIT compilers
===============================

* Huge resource investment
* The richer the semantics, the harder to write
* Poor encoding of language semantics
* Hard to evolve

Need for novel approaches!

PyPy Approach: Goal
=============================

.. raw:: html

   <br>

.. image:: overview2.png
   :align: center


Basics
=======================

* Use partial evaluation techniques to generate a dynamic compiler
  from an interpreter 
* Inspiration: Psyco 
* Our translation tool-chain was designed for trying this

Futamura
=====================

* *Partial evalution of computation process -
  an approach to a compiler-compiler*, 1971

* Generating compilers from interpreters
  with automatic specialization

* Relatively little practical impact so far

General idea
================

Partial evaluation (PE):

* Assume the Python bytecode to be constant, and
  constant-propagate it into the Python
  interpreter.


PE for dummies
==============

+---------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
| | def f(x, y):      | | *(case x=3)*     | | *(case x=10)*       |
| |   x2 = x * x      | | def f_3(y):      | | def f_10(y):        |
| |   y2 = y * y      | |   y2 = y * y     | |   y2 = y * y        |
| |   return x2 + y2  | |   return 9 + y2  | |   return 100 + y2   |
+---------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+

* What happens if x is the bytecode instead of an integer?


Challenges
======================

* A shortcoming of PE is that in many cases not much can be really
  assumed constant at compile-time: poor results

* Effective dynamic compilation requires feedback of runtime
  information into compile-time

* For a dynamic language: types are a primary example

Solution: Promotion
====================

* Enhance PE with the ability
  to "promote" run-time values
  to compile-time

* Leverage the dynamic setting


Overall ingredients
=====================

The pieces to enable effective dynamic compiler generation
in PyPy:

- a few hints in the Python interpreter to guide the JIT
  generator
- *promotion*
- lazy allocation of objects (only on escape)
- use CPU stack and registers for the contents of the Python frame

..  ("virtualizables")

Language-agnostic
====================

* The dynamic generation process and primitives are language-agnostic.

* The language implementations should be able to evolve up to
  maintaining the hints.

* By construction all interpreter/language features are supported


pypy-c-jit
======================

PyPy 1.0 contains both the dynamic compiler generator and the start of
its application to PyPy's Python intepreter.

JIT refactoring in-progress.

* included are backends for IA32 and PPC
* experimental/incomplete CLI backend
* integer arithmetic operations are optimized
* for these, we are in the speed range of ``gcc -O0``


EXTRA MATERIAL
==================

* More about the JIT Generation:

  - The *Rainbow interpreter*
  - *Virtuals* and *Promotion*


Execution steps
===============

* Translation time

  - pypy-c-jit is translated into an executable

  - the JIT compiler is automatically generated

* Compile-time: the JIT compiler runs

* Runtime: the JIT compiled code runs

* Compile-time and runtime are intermixed


The Rainbow interpreter
==================================

* A special interpreter whose goal is to produce executable code

* Written in RPython

* Guided by a binding time analysis ("color" of the graphs)

* Green operations: executed at compile-time

* Red operations: produce code that executes the operation at runtime


Rainbow architecture
====================

* (translation time)

* Low-level flowgraphs are produced

* The *hint-annotator* colors the variables

* The *rainbow codewriter* translates flowgraphs into rainbow bytecode

* (compile-time)

* The rainbow interpreter executes the bytecode

* As a result, it procude executable code

* (runtime)

* The code produced by the rainbow interpreter is executed



Coloring
=================

* Green: compile-time value
* Red: runtime value

* The hints give constraints from which the colors
  of all values are derived

We reuse the type inference
framework to propagate colors

PE with colors
====================

* Green operations: unchanged, executed at compile-time

* Red operations: converted into corresponding code emitting code

+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| | ``def f(`` :green:`x`, :red:`y` ``):``      | | *(case x=3)*                          | | *(case x=10)*                              |
| |   :green:`x2` = :green:`x` ``*`` :green:`x` | | ``def f_3(y):``                       | | ``def f_10(y):``                           |
| |   :red:`y2`   = :red:`y`   ``*`` :red:`y`   | |   ``y2 = y * y``                      | |   ``y2 = y * y``                           |
| |   ``return`` :green:`x2` ``+`` :red:`y2`    | |   ``return 9 + y2``                   | |   ``return 100 + y2``                      |
+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

PE Control Flow
===========================

- red split points: schedule multiple compilation states 
- merge points: merge logic to reuse code for equivalent states

+-----------------------------+----------------------------+
| | ``if`` :red:`x`:          | | :green:`(case y != 0)`   |
| |   ``print "x is true"``   | | ``if x:``                |
| | ``if`` :green:`y`:        | |   ``print "x is true"``  |
| |   ``print "y is true"``   | | ``print "y is true"``    |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------+

Promotion
=================

Promotion is implemented generating a switch that grows to cover the
seen runtime values

* First compilation stops at a promotion point and generates a switch
  with only a default case.  The default will call back into
  the compiler with runtime values.
  
* On callback the compiler adds one more case to the switch and
  generate more code assuming the received value.

.. need to save state in a compact form: paths

Conclusion (JIT)
================

Effective dynamic compiler generation make flexibility and ease of
evolution mostly **orthogonal to the performance question**.

Implementers are free to implement languages as **understandable interpreters**.

PyPy proves this a viable approach worth of further exploration.

.. virtualizables: not for general talk
.. state of gc framework

Open Issues
==============

- inlining control

- promotion switch explosion fallbacks

- jit only the hot-spots

- more hints needed in PyPy's Python

Virtualizable Frames
======================

- frames need to live in the heap
  (tracebacks ...) and be introspectable
- jit code wants local variables to live in registers
  and on the stack
- => mark the frame class as "virtualizable"
- jit code uses lazy allocation and stores
  some contents (local variables...) in register
  and stack
- outside world access gets intercepted
  to be able to force lazy virtual data into the heap
