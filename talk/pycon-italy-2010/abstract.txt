PyPy 1.2: snakes never crawled so fast
======================================

PyPy 1.2 has been recently released: the highlight of the new version is on
the new JIT compiler, which can hugely increase the performances of Python
programs.

In this talk we explain how the JIT compiler is implemented, and most
importantly how it works from the point of view of the user: in particular, we
see which kind of programs can benefit most from the presence of the JIT.

Finally, we present a way to integrate PyPy into existing applications based
on CPython, to gradually make the performance critical parts to be executed by
PyPy and get its benefits already now.
