Requested Timeslot

45 minutes?  Or two 30 minutes?  Or?

Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

PyPy, the notorious Python-in-Python project reached a significant
milestone in the summer of 2005: being able to produce a standalone
python interpreter with no dependencies on any of CPython's C code.
This talk will describe the toolchain that got us to this point and
what we plan on doing with it next.

Presentation Outline
--------------------

Something like:

- Introduction to PyPy
- Demo of pypy-c.
- Overview (with the fruit object space again? :)
- Our toolchain: the annotator, the rtyper, the backends.
- Future plans: JIT, logic programming, other backends.
- About the project: The EU, sprints, TDD, etc.

Intended audience
-----------------

Anyone interested, talk should be accessible to anyone who knows
Python reasonably well.
