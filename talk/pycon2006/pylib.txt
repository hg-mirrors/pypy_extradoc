Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

Title: py library and beyond 

Already known for its widely used "py.test" testing tool, the
"py lib" has more to offer.  We are going to explore the
experimental package "name export mechanism" involving lazy
imports, a lightweight tag/keyword-based logging scheme, 
subversion and local Path objects and compatibility modules that 
make recent Python library modules uniformly available from older 
Python versions.  We also will glance into the current state of 
"py.execnet" which explores new interprocess-communication 
facilities.  All of these features are already used by a growing 
number of projects.  We will give an overview of what comes next. 

Presentation Outline
--------------------

The py lib is a development support library 
and evolves from a strictly test-driven process. 
Apart from its intense usage in the PyPy project 
a number of other projects have adapted its methods. 

The current key parts of the py lib we are to present: 

- py.log: keyword & subscription based lazy logging 
- py.compat: use newer standard library modules from older
             python versions
- py.initpkg: export name/lazy import mechanism ("import py" 
              is all you ever need to do).
- py.path.*: path objects unifying access to svn- and
             local filesystems. 
- py.execnet: distributing programs across ssh- and process
              networks. 

We look at the next challenges for py lib development: 

- extending py.execnet to use it for peer-to-peer situations
- extending/refactoring py.path to support in-memory 
  and other filesystems 
- integrating twisted testing functionality into py.test 
- release plan 

Intended audience
-----------------

All python developers (who are interested in lightweight libraries and 
lean pythonnic APIs in order to support agile development).
