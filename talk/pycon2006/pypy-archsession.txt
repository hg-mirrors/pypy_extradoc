Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

After reaching important milestones, the PyPy project is 
now heading towards building a specializing JIT-compiler, 
stackless features and translation to higher level languages 
into the code base.   In this session we will present 
and interactively discuss with the audience basic 
architectural pictures.  We'd are going to emphasize the 
various emerging possibilities for further development 
part of which will be an ongoing effort of the 
European Union's funded part of the PyPy project. 

Presentation Outline
--------------------

We'll describe architectural pictures and point 
out extension and optimization possibilities: 

- Language Implementation: Bytecode Interpreter and Object Space interaction
- Translation to low level languages (C/LLVM)
- Translation to higher level languages (e.g. Squeak/Java) 
- JIT-compiler architecture (very-low-level interpreter) 
- Interweaving of Garbage Collection, threading and stackless
  operations into the translation process 

Intended audience
-----------------

People who feel comfortable with receiving too much information 
and accept that there are more levels of architecture involved 
than a single person can instantly cope with.
