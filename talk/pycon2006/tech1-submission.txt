Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

PyPy, the notorious Python-in-Python project reached a significant
milestone in the summer of 2005: being able to produce a standalone
python interpreter with no dependencies on any of CPython's C code.

This talk will describe as much of the toolchain that got us to this
point as it's possible to cram into 30 minutes :).

Presentation Outline
--------------------

- Introduction to PyPy.
- Demo of pypy-c.
- Overview.
- Our Toolchain: 
  + The Flow Object Space.
  + The Annotator.
  + The RTyper.
  + The Backend(s)

Intended audience
-----------------

Anyone interested, talk should be accessible to anyone who knows
Python reasonably well.
