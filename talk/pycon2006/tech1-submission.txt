30 minutes.

Summary of proposed presentation
--------------------------------

PyPy, the notorious Python-in-Python project reached a significant
milestone in the summer of 2005: being able to produce a standalone
python interpreter with no dependencies on any of CPython's C code.

This talk will describe the toolchain that got us to this point and
what we plan on doing with it next.

Presentation Outline
--------------------

- Introduction to PyPy
- Demo of pypy-c.
- Overview (with the fruit object space again? :)
- Our toolchain: 
  + the flow object space
  + the annotator
  + the rtyper
  + the backends
- Future plans: JIT, logic programming, other backends.

Intended audience
-----------------

Anyone interested, talk should be accessible to anyone who knows
Python reasonably well.
