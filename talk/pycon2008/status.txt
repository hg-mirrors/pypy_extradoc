Status of PyPy
==============

:Author: Maciej Fijalkowski, merlinux GmbH
:Title: PyPy from the user perspective
:Date: XXX

Next half an hour
=================

* PyPy motivation and status

* What we're working on

* A few examples of why it works

* Where we're going

* Why you should not use RPython

* Implementation details available on Sunday evening

PyPy - motivation
=================================

* CPython is nice, but not very flexible

* IronPython, Jython - bound to the specific VM

* Separate language specification from low-level details,
  such as GC or just in time compilation

* Psyco and Stackless Python hard to maintain

PyPy - user motivation
=======================

* One shall never be forced to write anything in C
  for performance reasons (with some exceptions: embedded
  devices etc.)

* Just-in-time compiler should make number-crunching
  and static-enough code fast enough

* One shall never care about low-level details

Status of PyPy
==============

* Very compliant language (to Python 2.4/2.5)

* Some modules from stdlib missing, no 3rd party
  modules at all

* Recently - ctypes

Status of PyPy backends
=======================

* We can compile to C and LLVM including threads (GIL),
  stackless (but not both), different GCs and all modules

* We can compile to CLI and JVM with reduced set of modules,
  no threads

* Some bindings to .NET for CLI, working on getting
  Java libraries to the JVM PyPy

Status of speed in PyPy
=======================

* Hard to find decent python-only benchmarks in the wild

* Pystone 1.5, Richards 1., gcbench 0.9 (compared to CPython 2.5)

* Real world apps usually 1.5-2., sometimes as slow as 3x.

Status of JIT in PyPy
=====================

* A lot of work has happened

* Even more needs to happen

* If your problem is similiar enough to counting Fibonacci numbers,
  we're as fast as psyco

* PyPy's JIT is way easier to extend (think PPC, think 64 bit,
  think floats)

RPython
=======

* The static subset of Python which we used for implementing the
  interpreter

* Our compiler toolchain analyzes RPython (i.e. interpreter source code,
  like C), not the user program

* Our interpreter is a "normal Python" interpreter

* The user has nothing to do with RPython

RPython (2)
===========

* It's not a general purpose language

* One has to have a very good reason to use it

* Clunky error messages (XXX demo)

* It's fast, helps us not to code in C

* Ideally, our JIT will achieve the same level of speed

RPython - language
==================

* It's high level but only convenient if you want to write interpreters :-)

* Usually tons of metaprogramming

* Like C++ - you can write books about tricks

* Hard to extend

XXX this slides needs to fit somewhere

Example of useful feature - sandboxing
======================================

* we analyze interpreter source (not user code) for
  all external function calls

* we replace them all with stubs interacting only with
  stdin/stdout

* small piece of code to trust (no worry about 3rd party modules
  or whatever)

* very flexible policy

* special switches for buffer overflows and common
  errors in interpreters (disregard to user code!)

* can work as well with smalltalk or prolog vm (XXX kill this?)

XXX demo

Example of useful feature - tproxy
===================================

* app-level code for controlling behavior of
  any type (even frames or tracebacks)

* very similiar concept to .NET VM transparent
  proxy

XXX demo

Example of useful feature - distribution
=========================================

* very simple distribution protocol built
  on top of transparent proxy

* done in smalltalk in 70s

* can work on any types, so you can
  raise remote traceback and everything will be fine

* nice experiment, few lines of code (XXX how many exactly?)

XXX demo

PyPy - future
=============

* Making 3rd party modules run on PyPy - you can help,
  notably by porting some to ctypes

* Making different programs run on PyPy - you can help

* We're thinking about providing different ways of getting
  3rd party modules

PyPy - JIT future
=================

* A lot of work happening (demos on Sunday)

* Short term goal - more general Python programs seeing speedups

* Machine code backend: need support for floats, better assembler

* A lot of benchmarking and tweaking

* Yes, you can help as well
