================================================================

* Presenter name(s) & contact information (email, telephone).

Intended audience
=================

This tutorial is intended for people who has a desire to modify python's
virtual machine, being uncomfortable with some design decisions, want an
extra feature, fast modules not written in C or just a wish to experiment.
Python fluency, including prior experience with meta-programming will be
expected from atendees. No knowledge of C is needed nor required, although
prior knowledge of any virtual machine (for example CPython) might be
useful.

Tutorial format description
===========================

A brief introduction to pypy codebase and concepts, then hands-on session
with pre-prepared tasks.

Recording
=========

I give permission to record and publish my PyCon tutorial for free
distribution.

Requirements
============

XXX prepare

Promotional summary
===================

Ever missed feature in your Python interpreter? Ever wondered how to write
extensions in Python rather than C or Pyrex? Ever wondered how pypy works?

This tutorial will give you detailed description how the PyPy python
interpreter is constructed and how to change it to meet your needs.
It'll also contain simple changes to the interpreter codebase as live coding
session. Afterwards will be welcomed to experiment in groups on they're own
on implementing prepared interpreter changes.

Attendees are welcome to bring their own laptops.
