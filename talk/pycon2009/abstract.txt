PyPy status talk
================

In this talk, I'll present the improvements that happened last year in PyPy. 
PyPy went a long way from being purely a research project towards being a
usable python interpreter. Although pypy is not yet a viable CPython
replacement, PyPy is able to run sophisticated python applications like
django or twisted. This talk will also contain a part about the motivations driving
current PyPy's developement and its targets for the future.
