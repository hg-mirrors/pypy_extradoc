PyPy status talk
================

In this talk, I'll present the improvements that happened last year in PyPy. 
PyPy went a long way from being purely a research project towards being a
usable python interpreter. Although pypy is not yet a viable CPython
replacement, PyPy is able to run sophisticated python applications like
django or twisted. This talk will also contain a part about the motivations driving
current PyPy's developement and its targets for the future.

Detailed description
====================

In this talk I would concetrate mostly on rapid progress which pypy project has
undertaken during last year (since last pycon talk). It includes things like
running large python applications/frameworks on top of pypy, but also
thinks like upcoming release (which hopefully will happen before pycon)
and also various platforms support, like nokia's supported maemo for
mobile devices. Since there is long way from now till pycon, it's hard to
predict what else might happen.

I would also like to talk about pypy's potential future, where we are going
and how we would like to approach XXX finish this sentence reasonably

I think pypy project, despite recent progress in this area, still lacks
deeper community understanding and hence this talk will try to clarify
many details about the future and goals of pypy project.

XXX maybe insert guido's interest in pypy becoming the next impl?
