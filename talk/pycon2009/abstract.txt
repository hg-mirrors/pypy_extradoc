PyPy status talk
================

In this talk, I'll present last year of improvements that happened in the pypy
area. PyPy went a long way from being a research project towards being a
usable python interpreter. Although pypy is not yet viable cpython
replacement, PyPy is able to run sophisticated python applications like
django or twisted. Talk will also contain part about motivation driving
PyPy's developement and targets for the future.
