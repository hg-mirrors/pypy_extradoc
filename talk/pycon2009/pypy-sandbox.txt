Presenter bio: 

Holger Krekel is a co-founder of the PyPy project and
participates on many levels in it.  He is the initiator and
maintainer of the popular py.test and a few other tools.  In
2004 he founded merlinux, a company focusing on PyPy and py.test 
developments.  Holger has talks at many EuroPython and 
PyCon confereces and gave well received testing

Talk summary: 

Have you been looking for ways how to run untrusted Python
code or how to restrict file and other IO access?  Not
satisfied with what you found so far? 
We'll showcase the PyPy approach which allows to run
unrestricted Python code but control all file, IO, CPU and RAM
resources.  We'll discuss the underlying model and discuss
shortcomings and future possibilities.
