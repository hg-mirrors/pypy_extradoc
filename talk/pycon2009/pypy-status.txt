PyPy status talk
================

PyPy has come a long way.  It's gone from being purely a research project to
providing a flexible and reasonably fast Python Interpreter, itself implemented 
in Python.  Although PyPy is not yet a viable CPython replacement, PyPy is able 
to run sophisticated python applications like Django and Twisted.  In this 
talk, we'll focus on improvements that happened during the last year in PyPy.
This talk will also explain the motivations driving current PyPy
developement and its targets for the future.

Detailed description
====================

In this talk we will concentrate on the rapid progress which
the PyPy project has undertaken since Pycon US 2008.  This
progress includes things like running large Python
applications/frameworks on top of PyPy, an upcoming release
(which hopefully will happen before PyCon) and support for
various new platforms.  For example, PyPy now supports the
Maemo platform for mobile devices.  Moreover, we will talk
about the our improved Garbage collectors and also highlight
current JIT status and plans. 

We would also like to talk about PyPy's future, where we are going and how we
would like to approach building a larger community and user-base.

We think that PyPy project, despite recent progress in this area, still
lacks deeper community understanding and hence this talk will try to
clarify many details and uncertanities about the PyPy project.
