PyPy status talk
================

PyPy has come a long way.  It's gone from being purely a research project to
providing a flexible and reasonably fast Python Interpreter, itself implemented 
in Python.  Although PyPy is not yet a viable CPython replacement, PyPy is able 
to run sophisticated python applications like Django and Twisted.  In this 
talk, we'll focus on improvements that happened during the last year in PyPy.
This talk will also explain the motivations driving current PyPy
developement and its targets for the future.

Detailed description
====================

In this talk we will concentrate on the rapid progress which
the PyPy project has undertaken since Pycon US 2008.  This
progress includes things like running large Python
applications/frameworks on top of PyPy, an upcoming release
(which hopefully will happen before PyCon) and support for
various new platforms.  For example, PyPy now supports the
Maemo platform for mobile devices.  Moreover, we will talk
about the our improved Garbage collectors and also highlight
current JIT status and plans. 

After we stated the goals of current PyPy developers we would
then like to discuss with the audience about their interests 
in PyPy.  While there are a lot of people interested 
in the PyPy project (and rightfully so :) we feel that we do not do 
too well regarding getting a larger community involved.  We'd like
to understand better how we can improve.
