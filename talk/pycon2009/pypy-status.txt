PyPy status talk
================

In this talk, I'll present the improvements that happened last year in PyPy.
PyPy has come a long way.  It's gone from being purely a research project to
being a usable python interpreter.  Although PyPy is not yet a viable CPython
replacement, PyPy is able to run sophisticated python applications like Django
and Twisted. This talk will also explain the motivations driving current PyPy
developement and its targets for the future.

Detailed description
====================

In this talk I will concentrate on the rapid progress which the PyPy project
has undertaken during the last year, since the last PyCon talk.  This progress
includes things like running large Python applications/frameworks on top of
PyPy, an upcoming release (which hopefully will happen before PyCon) and
support for various new platforms.  For example, PyPy now supports the Maemo
platform for mobile devices.  Since there is a long way from now till PyCon,
the talk will also cover any unexpected developments between now and then.
 
I would also like to talk about PyPy's future, where we are going and how we
would like to approach building a larger community and user-base.
 
I think PyPy project, despite recent progress in this area, still lacks deeper
community understanding and hence this talk will try to clarify many details
about the future and goals of the PyPy project.
