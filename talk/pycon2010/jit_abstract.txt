The speed of PyPy's Python
==============================

Summary:

The first part of the talk will cover PyPy's speed achievements resulting 
from the last year's work on the Just-In-Time Compiler.  I'll present 
and discuss a number of benchmarks and compare against other Python-speed 
projects.  And I'll cover the basics of how the JIT works and what 
sort of programs it can greatly speedup (and which ones it can't).

Description:

PyPy's JIT has been in development for some years now.  More recently
it became more practical and begins to be faster than Psyco on some
examples.  This is the status in September 2009 and currently it's fast-paced
development so we expect to have very interesting results for February 2010,
worth discussing and comparing.  If possible a 45 minute talk would be cool 
due to the "explaining the JIT" bit of the talk.
