The speed of PyPy
=================

Summary:

First part of the talk will cover PyPy's speed achievements, especially
connected to the last year's work on JIT. It'll present benchmarks together
with compatibility comparison. Second part of the talk will cover
basics of how the JIT work and what sort of programs it can greatly
speedup (and which ones it can't).

Description:

PyPy's JIT has been in development for quite a while so far and recently
it started showing some real benefits (being faster than psyco on
medium sized benchmarks) (XXX link). XXX finish
