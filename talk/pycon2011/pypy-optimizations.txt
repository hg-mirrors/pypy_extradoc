Title: Optimizations in PyPy
Description:

PyPy is a virtual machine for Python, featuring an advanced just in time compiler, which can deliver exceptional performance.  This talk is going to be a deep dive into what exactly makes Python such a hard language to optimize, how PyPy is organized, and what optimizations our JIT can do for your code.

Session type: Talk
Classification: Discuss in depth
Abstract:

This talk is 3 parts, what's hard to optimize about Python, how PyPy is organized, and what optimizations our JIT can do.

I. Why Python is hard (8 minutes)
    A) Dynamic language
    B) Frame introspection.
    C) Object model.
    D) CPython
        1) Interpretation
        2) Boxing
II. How PyPy is organized (5 minutes)
    A) Written in Python
    B) RPython
    C) The JIT
        1) Source transformation on the code
        2) Orthogonal to the interpreter
III. Optimizations the JIT does (13 minutes)
    A) Unboxing
    B) Attribute lookup
        1) "Hidden classes"
    C) Globals/builtin "freezing"
    D) array module
    E) The future
        1) ctypes
IV. Questions (4 minutes)
