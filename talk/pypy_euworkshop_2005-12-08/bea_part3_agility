1. 

- Agile development grew out of a need to handle rapid change
  in processes surrounding commercial software development

- How then do agile approaches fit distributed, open-source projects without
  the need to handle changing formal requirements and client relations?

- The answer points to the core of Agile practises: the people factor
  "Agile processes are designed to capitalize on each individual and each team´s
  unique strenghts" (Cockburn, Highsmith, 2001)

- The OSS nature of teams being self-organized and intensely collaborative fits the
  agile approach, although OSS teams are an unique implementation due to the distributed 
  nature of work

2. 

- Agile approaches aim at:
  * reducing 		"cost of information" and distance between decision-making and it´s implementation
  * by 			locating the team closer in a physical sense, replace documentation with face-to-face dissemination
  * resulting in	improved sense of community and team "morale", the foundation of  pro-active teams

- OSS teams fit the criteria very well if you look at the "physical" aspect in a more unorthodox sense. Transparent 
  intense, daily communication via IRC, emails and wiki:s make up for a lot of this.

- It is no wonder though that the Python community (Zope Foundation) tailored agile approaches to add one crucial
  technique, sprints, to make up for the lack of "physical" interaction between programmers. This technique is now 
  widely used within the Python community.
  
3. 

- Sprints are ""two-day or three-day focused development session, in which developers pair off 
  together in a room and focus on building a particular subsystem". In this implementation it fits
  agile criterias because of the knowledge/learning aspects as well as the incremental approaches.

- Sprinting was the key agile technique in the start-up of PyPy, work being non-funded. While working on the 
  proposal (during sprints) the challenge was to tailor a project process based on sprinting that would fit and 
  work within an EU framework. (picture - sprint process)

- Sprinting is central to the PyPy project because it is the focus point of the funded, consortium-based efforts
  as well as the non-funded OSS efforts. Primarily focused on programming but there are also regular dissemination
  activities (tutorials, talks) as well as consortium/management coordination.

4. 

- "Agile teams are characterized by self-organization and intense collaboration, within and across organizational
  boundaries" (Cockburn, Highsmith, 2001) How do one structure an agile OSS community into a consortium of 7 partners?
  
- In order to stay true to the agile vision as much as possible, the consortium structure and roles/responsibilities
  are supporting a developer-driven, flat organization. Much of the coordination of work is delegated to the core 
  developers. Regular "sync" meetings (once per week) are done via IRC in which the community of developers (funded 
  as well as non-funded) coordinate development work, keeping communication as transparent as possible.
  
- Consortium meetings are done once every month via IRC with developers attending as well, physical consortium meetings
  are done in conjunction with sprints. The tools for automated test driven development and version control are implemented
  on consortium documentation, reducing the gap between the consortium and the community in ways of working.
  
- Contribution from the community is partially funded through the process of "physical persons", entering the consortium
  as individual partners, recieving funding for travel and accommodation during sprints.
  
- Striking a balance between agile approaches within the OSS community of PyPy and the funded consortium structure of PyPy
  is a constant challenge but an crucial one. The results from the first year of the project show important results supporting
  this effort.
