SEMINAR
Best Practice in the Use and Development of Free and Open Source Software
3. Case study:

Part 2/Holger:

Slides:


1. personal background 
   - worked in gaming companies, banks and car companies for
     several years
   - studied computer science 
   - left job and went into open-source scenes (2001)
   - various project involvements, started PyPy 2003 by
     inviting people to the first "sprint"

2. What makes Open Source communities like Python work: the people factor

	- collaborative - driven by interest 
	- communication - quite transparent to everyone involved 
	- email / IRC / version-control 
	- organization - rather informal 

3. the technical factors 

	- automated test driven development
    - specific expertise/special interest 
	- version control (Subversion)
	- releases

4. Typical aspects of the Python community?

	- lively community
	- lots of different python implementation projects
	- good contactsbetween the projects
	- maybe less fragmented than other OSS communities?

5. PyPy: the vision

	- founders came from the Python community
	- "sprints" were the inital factor
	- what is PyPy/Python - one of the five most used programming
	  languages today 
	

6. OSS and EU funding: PyPy as a case study

	- driven by EU funded and non-EU funded parties 
	- technically challenging 
    - IBM or Sun have done similarly challenging projects
      in much more time and with more funding 

7. PyPy: It's all about communication ... 
	- pypy-sync meetings, 30 minutes IRC 
    - pypy-svn/eu-tracking tracks all code and document
      changes 
    - around 20000 visitors per month on website
    - lots of blogs and subscribers to pypy-dev (dev-list) 
    - 300-500 people across the world following the project
