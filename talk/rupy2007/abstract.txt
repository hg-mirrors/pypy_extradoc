Title: PyPy, the implementation of Python in Python
Abstract: We'd like to present the PyPy project, which is both
very very flexible compiler toolchain, which translates restricted subset
of python to variety of languages (C, LLVM, CLI, JVM, JavaScript...) and
implementation of a Python interpreter, with many novel features, including
Psyco-style specializing JIT, stackless-like coroutines and many others.
