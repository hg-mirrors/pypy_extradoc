Title: PyPy, Python interpreter written in Python

Abstract: In this talk I would like to present the PyPy project, our motivation,
state of art and targets. PyPy is both an extremely flexible python interpreter
written in Python itself to avoid burden of writing in low-level languages
(like C) and compiler toolchain which compiles restricted python to a variety
of lower-level platforms (including C/POSIX, CLI, JVM...). I would like to
present some cool features, especially those created since the last rupy
conference in 2007. Also, I would like to showcase directions in which
the PyPy project is going, including even more agressive JIT compilation.
