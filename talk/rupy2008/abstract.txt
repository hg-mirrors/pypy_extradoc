Title: PyPy, Python interpreter written in Python

Abstract: XXX

Why another python interpreter?

CPython is cool, but has limitations.

Writing in C is ugly and unefficient.

Let's write high-level interpreter in high-level language!

Our cool features (which you haven't seen yet):

* sandboxing
* jit (python is too dynamic, let's compile it dynamically)
* stackless (?)
* frame pickling
* gc in action
