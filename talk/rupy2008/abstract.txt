Title: PyPy - status and next goals 

Abstract: I'd like to present the status and next goals of
the PyPy project: both a platform for implementing dynamic languages
and a complete Python Interpreter written in a high level language.  
PyPy translates interpreters to C, .NET and the JVM.  The talk will 
focus on what is new since the last RUPY conference.  I am going to 
talk about speed and feature improvements, including our flexible
garbage collection framework and status and future of our Just-in-time
compiler generator. This generator is used to automatically turn
python interpreter into compiler directly emiting assembler code,
extending the idea of the Psyco project.
