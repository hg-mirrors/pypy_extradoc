PyPy status talk
================

In this talk I would like to give update on the status of
the PyPy project. Most of the talk will focus on the PyPy's JIT,
new feature that allows to run (some so far) programs really
fast. I'll also present details how to exploit JIT's possiblities
and future directions.

Bio:

I'm a core developer of the PyPy project, involved in it for
last couple years. In recent years I spent lot of time improving
dynamic compilation features of PyPy as well as improving general
PyPy compatibility.
