PyPy status talk
================

In this talk I would like to give update on the status of
the PyPy project. Most of the talk will focus on the PyPy's JIT,
new feature that allows to run (some so far) programs really
fast. I'll also present details how to exploit JIT's possiblities
and future directions.
