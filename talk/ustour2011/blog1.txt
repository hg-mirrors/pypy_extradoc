The PyPy San Franciso tour 2011

PyPy is coming to San Francisco beginning of March with a series of talks
and sprints:

* Wednesday March 2, 4:15 p.m.  Armin gives talk at Stanford.
  http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/winter-schedule-20102011.html
  open to the public.

* Thursday March 3, 6:00 p.m.  General talk at Yelp, 706 Mission St 9th Floor,
  San Francisco CA 94103 open to the public.

* Saturday and Sunday March 5 and 6.
  PyPy mini sprint at noisebridge. 2169 mission street between 17th and 18th in
  san francisco. http://www.noisebridge.net   Open to the public.

* Monday March 7th.  11:30 a.m.  Google Tech talk.  Not open to the public
  (but probably to Googlers).

* Monday March 7th.  2:30 p.m. Talk at Mozilla.  Not open to the public
  (but probably to Mozilla devs).

From the PyPy project team we will have Armin Rigo, Maciej Fijalkowski
(from 6th March), Laura Creighton and Jacob Hallen at these events.
Most of the talks will focus on (some of) the highlights and the
status of pypy:

* most Python benchmarks run much faster than with CPython or Psyco
* the real-world PyPy compiler toolchain itself (200 KLocs) runs twice as fast
* supports 64bit and is in the process of supporting ARM
* full compatibility with CPython (more than Jython/IronPython)
* full (and JIT-ed) ctypes support to call C libraries from Python
* supports Stackless Python (in-progress)
* new "cpyext" layer which integrates existing CPython C extensions
* an experimental super-fast JIT-compilation of calls to C++ libraries

Apart from getting more technical and project insight, our travel is
a also a good possibility for companies in the SF area to talk to us
regarding contracting.  In September 2011 our current "Eurostars" research
project ends and some of us are looking for consulting/subcontracts or hiring
related to PyPy.  We have two companies, Open End and merlinux, who
have successfully done a number of contracts and projects in the past.
If you want to talk business or get together for dinner, let us know!
