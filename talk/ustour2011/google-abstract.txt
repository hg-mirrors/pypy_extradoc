The PyPy project has gathered recently a lot of attention for its progress
on speeding up the python language. In this talk we would like to discuss
what the PyPy project is, what we achieved in past two years in the area
of dynamic language interpreters and where we'll go from now.

With our recent round of optimizations, we got most benchmarks
running faster than CPython, the original Python interpreter -- and
faster than Psyco too, the existing Python specializing JIT
compiler. Our goal is to reach the time when rewriting parts of a
Python program to C for performance would not be necessary. One good
example of our approach is our own translation toolchain, which a
large (200K lines of code) Python program not originally written for
PyPy, which runs faster by a factor of two.

PyPy is the most compatible and stable alternative python interpreter
out there.  It already passes the CPython test suite, with minor
changes that have been agreed to be implementation-specific issues by
the Python community.  Recently, a lot of work has been put into
integrating PyPy with C-based extensions, but a lot more can be
done about it (e.g. compatibility with SWIG or Cython).
