The PyPy project has gathered recently a lot of attention for its progress
on speeding up the Python language. In this talk we would like to discuss
what the PyPy project achieved particularly in the past two years in the area
of dynamic language interpreters:

* most Python benchmarks run much faster than with CPython or Psyco
* the realworld PyPy compiler toolchain itself (200 KLocs) runs twice as fast
* 64bit and ARM are now supported
* full compatibility to CPython (much deeper and more than Jython/IronPython)
* fully pluggable Garbage Collection
* ctypes and new "cpyext" layer to integrate existing CPython C Extensions
* experimental super-fast JIT-compilation of calls from Python to C++ libraries

We'll also see to briefly highlight project backgrounds like number of
active developers and funding background to round up the view
on the project.
