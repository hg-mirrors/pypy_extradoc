The PyPy project has gathered recently a lot of attention for its
progress on speeding up the Python language -- it is the fastest,
most compatible and stable alternative Python interpreter:

* most Python benchmarks run much faster than with CPython or Psyco
* the real-world PyPy compiler toolchain itself (200 KLocs) runs twice as fast
* full compatibility to CPython (more than Jython/IronPython)

In this talk we will focus on how we reached this goal:

* "RPython", a subset of Python that our toolchain analyzes and compiles to C
* our Python interpreter is written in RPython
* pluggable GCs, also written in RPython
* JIT support automatically generated from the interpreter source code
* the JIT itself is also written in RPython

There are many interesting details that can be explored further;
we will focus on the points the audiance is most interested in.
