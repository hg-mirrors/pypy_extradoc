*PyPy mini-sprint*

Programming Language topic: this is a "sprint" (intensive
collaborative work) on PyPy, the Python interpreter written in Python.
 Everybody is welcome.  The goal is to show off and work on whatever
parts of PyPy people are interested in: the Just-in-Time Compiler,
Garbage Collectors, Stackless Python, or the Python 2.7 language
itself.
