    The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
    implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
    description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
    Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
    nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

Ongoing: PyPy Sprint in Heidelberg 22nd-29th August 2005
==========================================================

The current PyPy sprint takes place at the Heidelberg University
in Germany from 22nd August to 29th August (both days included). 
Its main focus is translation of the whole PyPy interpreter 
to a low level language and reaching 2.4.1 Python compliancy.
The goal of the sprint is to release a first self-contained
PyPy-0.7 version.  To learn more see the `Heidelberg sprint
announcement`_ or look at the list of people_ that are
expected to come.

PyPy Hildesheim2 finished: first self-contained PyPy run! 
===========================================================

Up until 31st August we were in a PyPy sprint at `Trillke-Gut`_. 
Carl has written a `report about day 1`_, Holger 
about `day 2 and day 3`_ and Carl again about `day 4 and day 5`_, 
On `day 6`_ Holger reports the `breakthrough`_: PyPy runs 
on its own! Hurray_!.  And Carl finally reports about the winding
down of `day 7`_ which saw us relaxing, discussing and generally 
having a good time.   You might want to look at the selected 
`pictures from the sprint`_.

EuroPython 2005 sprints finished 
======================================================

We had two sprints around EuroPython, one more internal core
developer one and a public one.  Both sprints were quite
successful.  Regarding the Pre-EuroPython sprint Michael Hudson 
has posted summaries of `day 1`_, `day 2`_ and `day 3`_ on 
the `pypy-dev`_ mailing list.  The larger public sprint 
has not been summarized yet but it went very well.  We had
20 people initially attending to hear the tutorials and 
work a bit.  Later with around 13-14 people we made the
move to Python-2.4.1, integrated the parser, improved 
the LLVM backends and type inference in general.

First PyPy release!
=================== 

We are happy to announce the first public release of PyPy after two years of
spare-time and half a year of EU funded development.  The 0.6 release is
a preview release, concentrating on CPython compatibility, good documentation 
and nice starting points into the PyPy code base.  We invite you to head 
over to the `getting started`_ document or read more in the 
`release announcement`_.  *(05/20/2005)*
